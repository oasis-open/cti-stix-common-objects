            "description": "go-crypto-winnative Go crypto backend for Windows using Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). Prior to commit f49c8e1379ea4b147d5bff1b3be5b0ff45792e41, calls to `cng.TLS1PRF` don't release the key handle, producing a small memory leak every time. Commit f49c8e1379ea4b147d5bff1b3be5b0ff45792e41 contains a fix for the issue. The fix is included in versions 1.23.6-2 and 1.22.12-2 of the Microsoft build of go, as well as in the pseudoversion 0.0.0-20250211154640-f49c8e1379ea of the `github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-winnative` Go package.",
