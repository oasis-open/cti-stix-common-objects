            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmemblock: make memblock_set_node() also warn about use of MAX_NUMNODES\n\nOn an (old) x86 system with SRAT just covering space above 4Gb:\n\n    ACPI: SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 [mem 0x100000000-0xfffffffff] hotplug\n\nthe commit referenced below leads to this NUMA configuration no longer\nbeing refused by a CONFIG_NUMA=y kernel (previously\n\n    NUMA: nodes only cover 6144MB of your 8185MB e820 RAM. Not used.\n    No NUMA configuration found\n    Faking a node at [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x000000027fffffff]\n\nwas seen in the log directly after the message quoted above), because of\nmemblock_validate_numa_coverage() checking for NUMA_NO_NODE (only). This\nin turn led to memblock_alloc_range_nid()'s warning about MAX_NUMNODES\ntriggering, followed by a NULL deref in memmap_init() when trying to\naccess node 64's (NODE_SHIFT=6) node data.\n\nTo compensate said change, make memblock_set_node() warn on and adjust\na passed in value of MAX_NUMNODES, just like various other functions\nalready do.",
