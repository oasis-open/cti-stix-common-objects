            "description": "The Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the get_items() and extra_tablenav() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform read-only actions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
