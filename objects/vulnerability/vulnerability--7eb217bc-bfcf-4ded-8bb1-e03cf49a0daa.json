Otherwise, the reference is\nfreed while its ref->freeze.work is still queued in proc->work leading\nto a use-after-free issue as shown by the following KASAN report:\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in binder_release_work+0x398/0x3d0\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff31600ee91488 by task kworker/5:1/211\n\n  CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 211 Comm: kworker/5:1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7-00382-gfc6c92196396 #22\n  Hardware name: linux,dummy-virt (DT)\n  Workqueue: events binder_deferred_func\n  Call trace:\n   binder_release_work+0x398/0x3d0\n   binder_deferred_func+0xb60/0x109c\n   process_one_work+0x51c/0xbd4\n   worker_thread+0x608/0xee8\n\n  Allocated by task 703:\n   __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x130/0x280\n   binder_thread_write+0xdb4/0x42a0\n   binder_ioctl+0x18f0/0x25ac\n   __arm64_sys_ioctl+0x124/0x190\n   invoke_syscall+0x6c/0x254\n\n  Freed by task 211:\n   kfree+0xc4/0x230\n   binder_deferred_func+0xae8/0x109c\n   process_one_work+0x51c/0xbd4\n   worker_thread+0x608/0xee8\n  ==================================================================\n\nThis commit fixes the issue by ensuring any queued freeze work is removed\nwhen cleaning up a binder reference.",
