            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/cma: Ensure rdma_addr_cancel() happens before issuing more requests\n\nThe FSM can run in a circle allowing rdma_resolve_ip() to be called twice\non the same id_priv. While this cannot happen without going through the\nwork, it violates the invariant that the same address resolution\nbackground request cannot be active twice.\n\n       CPU 1                                  CPU 2\n\nrdma_resolve_addr():\n  RDMA_CM_IDLE -> RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERY\n  rdma_resolve_ip(addr_handler)  #1\n\n\t\t\t process_one_req(): for #1\n                          addr_handler():\n                            RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERY -> RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND\n                            mutex_unlock(&id_priv->handler_mutex);\n                            [.. handler still running ..]\n\nrdma_resolve_addr():\n  RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND -> RDMA_CM_ADDR_QUERY\n  rdma_resolve_ip(addr_handler)\n    !! two requests are now on the req_list\n\nrdma_destroy_id():\n destroy_id_handler_unlock():\n  _destroy_id():\n   cma_cancel_operation():\n    rdma_addr_cancel()\n\n                          // process_one_req() self removes it\n\t\t          spin_lock_bh(&lock);\n                           cancel_delayed_work(&req->work);\n\t                   if (!list_empty(&req->list)) == true\n\n      ! rdma_addr_cancel() returns after process_on_req #1 is done\n\n   kfree(id_priv)\n\n\t\t\t process_one_req(): for #2\n                          addr_handler():\n\t                    mutex_lock(&id_priv->handler_mutex);\n                            !! Use after free on id_priv\n\nrdma_addr_cancel() expects there to be one req on the list and only\ncancels the first one. The self-removal behavior of the work only happens\nafter the handler has returned. This yields a situations where the\nreq_list can have two reqs for the same \"handle\" but rdma_addr_cancel()\nonly cancels the first one.\n\nThe second req remains active beyond rdma_destroy_id() and will\nuse-after-free id_priv once it inevitably triggers.\n\nFix this by remembering if the id_priv has called rdma_resolve_ip() and\nalways cancel before calling it again. This ensures the req_list never\ngets more than one item in it and doesn't cost anything in the normal flow\nthat never uses this strange error path.",
