            "description": "The Advanced Google reCAPTCHA plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP unblocking in all versions up to, and including, 1.25. This is due to the plugin not utilizing a strong unique key when generating an unblock request. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to unblock their IP after being locked out due to too many bad password attempts",
