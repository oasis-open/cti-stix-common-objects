            "description": "The Database Toolset plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4 via backup files stored in a publicly accessible location. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data from database backup files. An index file is present, so a brute force attack would need to be successful in order to compromise any data.",
