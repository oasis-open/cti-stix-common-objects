            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: xhci: prevent potential failure in handle_tx_event() for Transfer events without TRB\n\nSome transfer events don't always point to a TRB, and consequently don't\nhave a endpoint ring. In these cases, function handle_tx_event() should\nnot proceed, because if 'ep->skip' is set, the pointer to the endpoint\nring is used.\n\nTo prevent a potential failure and make the code logical, return after\nchecking the completion code for a Transfer event without TRBs.",
