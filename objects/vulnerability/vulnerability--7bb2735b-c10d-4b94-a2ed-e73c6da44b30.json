            "description": "The Shared Files – Frontend File Upload Form & Secure File Sharing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via html File uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.48 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping within the sanitize_file() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the plugin’s MIME-only checks and inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses the html file.",
