            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: virt_wifi: avoid reporting connection success with wrong SSID\n\nWhen user issues a connection with a different SSID than the one\nvirt_wifi has advertised, the __cfg80211_connect_result() will\ntrigger the warning: WARN_ON(bss_not_found).\n\nThe issue is because the connection code in virt_wifi does not\ncheck the SSID from user space (it only checks the BSSID), and\nvirt_wifi will call cfg80211_connect_result() with WLAN_STATUS_SUCCESS\neven if the SSID is different from the one virt_wifi has advertised.\nEventually cfg80211 won't be able to find the cfg80211_bss and generate\nthe warning.\n\nFixed it by checking the SSID (from user space) in the connection code.",
