            "description": "Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. Synapse versions before 1.120.1 fail to properly validate invites received over federation. This vulnerability allows a malicious server to send a specially crafted invite that disrupts the invited user's /sync functionality. Synapse 1.120.1 rejects such invalid invites received over federation and restores the ability to sync for affected users.",
