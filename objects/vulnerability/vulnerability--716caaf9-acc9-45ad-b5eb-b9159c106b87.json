            "description": "** DISPUTED ** The BGP daemon in Extreme Networks ExtremeXOS (aka EXOS) 30.7.1.1 allows an attacker (who is not on a directly connected network) to cause a denial of service (BGP session reset) because of BGP attribute error mishandling (for attribute 21 and 25). NOTE: the vendor disputes this because it is \"evaluating support for RFC 7606 as a future feature\" and believes that \"customers that have chosen to not require or implement RFC 7606 have done so willingly and with knowledge of what is needed to defend against these types of attacks.\"",
