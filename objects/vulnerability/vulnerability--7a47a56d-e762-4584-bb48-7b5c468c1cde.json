            "description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability in\n\nthe routing protocol daemon (rpd) of \n\n Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, logically adjacent BGP peer sending a specifically malformed BGP packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n\n\nThis issue only affects systems configured in\n      either of two ways:\n\n    \n    \n        *  systems with BGP traceoptions enabled\n\n        *  systems with BGP family traffic-engineering (BGP-LS)\n          configured\n\n\n and can be exploited from a directly connected and configured BGP peer. \n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP \n\nwith \n\nany address family\n\n configured, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2, 24.2R2; \n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S3-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R1-S2-EVO, 24.2R2-EVO.\n\n\n\nThis is a similar, but different vulnerability than the issue reported as CVE-2024-39516.",
