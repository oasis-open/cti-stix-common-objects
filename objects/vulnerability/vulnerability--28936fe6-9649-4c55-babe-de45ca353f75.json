This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Xiaomi Pro 13 smartphones. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the manual-upgrade.html file. When parsing the manualUpgradeInfo parameter, the process does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-22379.",
