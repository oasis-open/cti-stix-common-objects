In version 2.1.4 and prior, the s parameter in GET requests for forum search functionality lacks length validation, allowing attackers to submit excessively long search queries. This oversight can lead to performance degradation and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.0.",
