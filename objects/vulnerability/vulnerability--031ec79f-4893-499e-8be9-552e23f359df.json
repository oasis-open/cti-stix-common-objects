            "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Visual Studio improperly handles pipeline job tokens. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could extend their access to a project.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to have access to the project and swap the short-term token for a long-term one.\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Visual Studio updater handles these tokens.",
