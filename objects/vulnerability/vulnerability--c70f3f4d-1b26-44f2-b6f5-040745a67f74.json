            "description": "In version 3.25.0 of aimhubio/aim, a denial of service vulnerability exists. By tracking a large number of `Text` objects and then querying them simultaneously through the web API, the Aim web server becomes unresponsive to other requests for an extended period while processing and returning these objects. This vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly, leading to a complete denial of service.",
