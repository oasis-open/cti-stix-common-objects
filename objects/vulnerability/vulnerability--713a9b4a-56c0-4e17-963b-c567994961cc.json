            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: xtables: avoid NFPROTO_UNSPEC where needed\n\nsyzbot managed to call xt_cluster match via ebtables:\n\n WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11 at net/netfilter/xt_cluster.c:72 xt_cluster_mt+0x196/0x780\n [..]\n ebt_do_table+0x174b/0x2a40\n\nModule registers to NFPROTO_UNSPEC, but it assumes ipv4/ipv6 packet\nprocessing.  As this is only useful to restrict locally terminating\nTCP/UDP traffic, register this for ipv4 and ipv6 family only.\n\nPablo points out that this is a general issue, direct users of the\nset/getsockopt interface can call into targets/matches that were only\nintended for use with ip(6)tables.\n\nCheck all UNSPEC matches and targets for similar issues:\n\n- matches and targets are fine except if they assume skb_network_header()\n  is valid -- this is only true when called from inet layer: ip(6) stack\n  pulls the ip/ipv6 header into linear data area.\n- targets that return XT_CONTINUE or other xtables verdicts must be\n  restricted too, they are incompatbile with the ebtables traverser, e.g.\n  EBT_CONTINUE is a completely different value than XT_CONTINUE.\n\nMost matches/targets are changed to register for NFPROTO_IPV4/IPV6, as\nthey are provided for use by ip(6)tables.\n\nThe MARK target is also used by arptables, so register for NFPROTO_ARP too.\n\nWhile at it, bail out if connbytes fails to enable the corresponding\nconntrack family.\n\nThis change passes the selftests in iptables.git.",
