            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in hid_ishtp_cl_remove()\n\nDuring the `rmmod` operation for the `intel_ishtp_hid` driver, a\nuse-after-free issue can occur in the hid_ishtp_cl_remove() function.\nThe function hid_ishtp_cl_deinit() is called before ishtp_hid_remove(),\nwhich can lead to accessing freed memory or resources during the\nremoval process.\n\nCall Trace:\n ? ishtp_cl_send+0x168/0x220 [intel_ishtp]\n ? hid_output_report+0xe3/0x150 [hid]\n hid_ishtp_set_feature+0xb5/0x120 [intel_ishtp_hid]\n ishtp_hid_request+0x7b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]\n hid_hw_request+0x1f/0x40 [hid]\n sensor_hub_set_feature+0x11f/0x190 [hid_sensor_hub]\n _hid_sensor_power_state+0x147/0x1e0 [hid_sensor_trigger]\n hid_sensor_runtime_resume+0x22/0x30 [hid_sensor_trigger]\n sensor_hub_remove+0xa8/0xe0 [hid_sensor_hub]\n hid_device_remove+0x49/0xb0 [hid]\n hid_destroy_device+0x6f/0x90 [hid]\n ishtp_hid_remove+0x42/0x70 [intel_ishtp_hid]\n hid_ishtp_cl_remove+0x6b/0xb0 [intel_ishtp_hid]\n ishtp_cl_device_remove+0x4a/0x60 [intel_ishtp]\n ...\n\nAdditionally, ishtp_hid_remove() is a HID level power off, which should\noccur before the ISHTP level disconnect.\n\nThis patch resolves the issue by reordering the calls in\nhid_ishtp_cl_remove(). The function ishtp_hid_remove() is now\ncalled before hid_ishtp_cl_deinit().",
