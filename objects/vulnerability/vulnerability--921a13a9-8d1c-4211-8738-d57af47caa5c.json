A security vulnerability was discovered in Gardener prior to versions 1.116.4, 1.117.5, 1.118.2, and 1.119.0 that could allow a user with administrative privileges for a Gardener project to obtain control over the seed cluster(s) where their shoot clusters are managed. This CVE affects all Gardener installations no matter of the public cloud provider(s) used for the seed clusters/shoot clusters. `gardener/gardener` (`gardenlet`) is the affected component. Versions 1.116.4, 1.117.5, 1.118.2, and 1.119.0 fix the issue.",
