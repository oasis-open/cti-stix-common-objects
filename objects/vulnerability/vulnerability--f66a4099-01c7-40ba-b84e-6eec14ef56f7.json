            "description": "The Discount Rules for WooCommerce â€“ Create Smart WooCommerce Coupons & Discounts, Bulk Discount, BOGO Coupons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note that this is only exploitable when the 'Leave a Review' notice is present, which occurs after 100 orders are made and disappears after a user dismisses the notice.",
