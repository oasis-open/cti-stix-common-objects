            "description": "The Tumult Hype Animations plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the hypeanimations_panel() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.15. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
