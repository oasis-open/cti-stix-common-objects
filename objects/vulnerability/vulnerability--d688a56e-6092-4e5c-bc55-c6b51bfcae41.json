            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors\n\nSyzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver. The problem still the\nsame -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller.\n\nSince all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() let's catch\nusb related error there and add __must_check notation to be sure all\ncallers actually check return value.\n\nSo, this patch adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply\nchecks if bytes read are not less, than was requested and adds missing\nerror handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.",
