            "description": "The Woocommerce Multiple Addresses plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.7.1. This is due to insufficient restrictions on user meta that can be updated through the save_multiple_shipping_addresses() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to elevate their privileges to that of an administrator.",
