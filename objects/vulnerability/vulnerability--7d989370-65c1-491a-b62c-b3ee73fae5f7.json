            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: fix race when vmap stack overflow\n\nCurrently, when detecting vmap stack overflow, riscv firstly switches\nto the so called shadow stack, then use this shadow stack to call the\nget_overflow_stack() to get the overflow stack. However, there's\na race here if two or more harts use the same shadow stack at the same\ntime.\n\nTo solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic var, which\nwill be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when the\nvar is set, it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the var\nis cleared, it means the shadow_stack isn't being used.\n\n[Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]",
