            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5e: IPoIB, Block PKEY interfaces with less rx queues than parent\n\nA user is able to configure an arbitrary number of rx queues when\ncreating an interface via netlink. This doesn't work for child PKEY\ninterfaces because the child interface uses the parent receive channels.\n\nAlthough the child shares the parent's receive channels, the number of\nrx queues is important for the channel_stats array: the parent's rx\nchannel index is used to access the child's channel_stats. So the array\nhas to be at least as large as the parent's rx queue size for the\ncounting to work correctly and to prevent out of bound accesses.\n\nThis patch checks for the mentioned scenario and returns an error when\ntrying to create the interface. The error is propagated to the user.",
