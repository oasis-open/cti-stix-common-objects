            "description": "Moxaâ€™s IP Cameras are affected by a medium-severity vulnerability, CVE-2024-9404, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition or cause a service crash. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit the Moxa service, commonly referred to as moxa_cmd, originally designed for deployment. Because of insufficient input validation, this service may be manipulated to trigger a denial-of-service.\n\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability poses a significant remote threat if the affected products are exposed to publicly accessible networks. Attackers could potentially disrupt operations by shutting down the affected systems. Due to the critical nature of this security risk, we strongly recommend taking immediate action to prevent potential exploitation.",
