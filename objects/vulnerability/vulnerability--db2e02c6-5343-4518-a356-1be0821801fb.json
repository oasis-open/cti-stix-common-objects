            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nEDAC/bluefield: Fix potential integer overflow\n\nThe 64-bit argument for the \"get DIMM info\" SMC call consists of mem_ctrl_idx\nleft-shifted 16 bits and OR-ed with DIMM index.  With mem_ctrl_idx defined as\n32-bits wide the left-shift operation truncates the upper 16 bits of\ninformation during the calculation of the SMC argument.\n\nThe mem_ctrl_idx stack variable must be defined as 64-bits wide to prevent any\npotential integer overflow, i.e. loss of data from upper 16 bits.",
