            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/pseries: Fix scv instruction crash with kexec\n\nkexec on pseries disables AIL (reloc_on_exc), required for scv\ninstruction support, before other CPUs have been shut down. This means\nthey can execute scv instructions after AIL is disabled, which causes an\ninterrupt at an unexpected entry location that crashes the kernel.\n\nChange the kexec sequence to disable AIL after other CPUs have been\nbrought down.\n\nAs a refresher, the real-mode scv interrupt vector is 0x17000, and the\nfixed-location head code probably couldn't easily deal with implementing\nsuch high addresses so it was just decided not to support that interrupt\nat all.",
