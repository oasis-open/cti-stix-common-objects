            "description": "Arista NG Firewall custom_handler Directory Traversal Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Arista NG Firewall. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the custom_handler method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user. Was ZDI-CAN-24019.",
