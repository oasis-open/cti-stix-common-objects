This is ultimately due to\nthe region(s), that this memdev is a member, being torn down and expecting\nto be able to de-reference @cxlds, like here:\n\nstatic int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region *cxlr, int count)\n...\n                if (cxlds->rcd)\n                        goto endpoint_reset;\n...\n\nFix it by keeping the driver context valid until memdev-device\nunregistration, and subsequently the entire stack of related\ndependencies, unwinds.",
