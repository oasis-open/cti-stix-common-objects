            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: xfrm: unexport __init-annotated xfrm4_protocol_init()\n\nEXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text\nsection is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot\nuse symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up\nwith kernel panic.\n\nmodpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.\n\nRecently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this\nshowed up in linux-next builds.\n\nThere are two ways to fix it:\n\n  - Remove __init\n  - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL\n\nI chose the latter for this case because the only in-tree call-site,\nnet/ipv4/xfrm4_policy.c is never compiled as modular.\n(CONFIG_XFRM is boolean)",
