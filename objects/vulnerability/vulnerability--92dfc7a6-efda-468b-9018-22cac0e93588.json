            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms\n\nThe array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by\nveml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7,\nwhich could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.\n\nCoverity Issue\nCID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)\noverrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte\nelements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using\nindex int_index (which evaluates to 7)\n\nThis is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have\nbut not necessary to backport.",
