            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfscache: Fix oops due to race with cookie_lru and use_cookie\n\nIf a cookie expires from the LRU and the LRU_DISCARD flag is set, but\nthe state machine has not run yet, it's possible another thread can call\nfscache_use_cookie and begin to use it.\n\nWhen the cookie_worker finally runs, it will see the LRU_DISCARD flag\nset, transition the cookie->state to LRU_DISCARDING, which will then\nwithdraw the cookie.  Once the cookie is withdrawn the object is removed\nthe below oops will occur because the object associated with the cookie\nis now NULL.\n\nFix the oops by clearing the LRU_DISCARD bit if another thread uses the\ncookie before the cookie_worker runs.\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n  ...\n  CPU: 31 PID: 44773 Comm: kworker/u130:1 Tainted: G     E    6.0.0-5.dneg.x86_64 #1\n  Hardware name: Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08/26/2022\n  Workqueue: events_unbound netfs_rreq_write_to_cache_work [netfs]\n  RIP: 0010:cachefiles_prepare_write+0x28/0x90 [cachefiles]\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n    netfs_rreq_write_to_cache_work+0x11c/0x320 [netfs]\n    process_one_work+0x217/0x3e0\n    worker_thread+0x4a/0x3b0\n    kthread+0xd6/0x100",
