            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts\n\nThis patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:\n\n  A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux\n  kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on\n  `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing\n  between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`\n  global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or\n  potential code execution.\n\nIn aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial\ncode is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in\nlater tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the\ndev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb\ninitial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into\nuse-after-free because the net_device is freed.\n\nThis patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in\naoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().",
