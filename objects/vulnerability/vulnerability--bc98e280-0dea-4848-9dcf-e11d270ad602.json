            "description": "Mitel MiCollab through 9.8 SP2 could allow an authenticated attacker with administrative privilege to conduct a local file read, due to insufficient input sanitization. A successful exploit could allow the authenticated admin attacker to access resources that are constrained to the admin access level, and the disclosure is limited to non-sensitive system information. This vulnerability does not allow file modification or privilege escalation.",
