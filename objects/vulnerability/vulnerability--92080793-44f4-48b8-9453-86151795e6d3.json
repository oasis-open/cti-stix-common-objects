            "description": "The Sky Addons for Elementor (Free Templates Library, Live Copy, Animations, Post Grid, Post Carousel, Particles, Sliders, Chart, Blog, Video Gallery) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_options() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Please note this is limited to option values that can be saved as arrays.",
