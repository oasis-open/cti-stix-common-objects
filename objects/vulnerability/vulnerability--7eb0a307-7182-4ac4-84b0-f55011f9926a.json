            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nf2fs: Require FMODE_WRITE for atomic write ioctls\n\nThe F2FS ioctls for starting and committing atomic writes check for\ninode_owner_or_capable(), but this does not give LSMs like SELinux or\nLandlock an opportunity to deny the write access - if the caller's FSUID\nmatches the inode's UID, inode_owner_or_capable() immediately returns true.\n\nThere are scenarios where LSMs want to deny a process the ability to write\nparticular files, even files that the FSUID of the process owns; but this\ncan currently partially be bypassed using atomic write ioctls in two ways:\n\n - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_REPLACE + F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE can\n   truncate an inode to size 0\n - F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE + F2FS_IOC_ABORT_ATOMIC_WRITE can revert\n   changes another process concurrently made to a file\n\nFix it by requiring FMODE_WRITE for these operations, just like for\nF2FS_IOC_MOVE_RANGE. Since any legitimate caller should only be using these\nioctls when intending to write into the file, that seems unlikely to break\nanything.",
