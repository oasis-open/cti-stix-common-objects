            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nclk: Fix clk_hw_get_clk() when dev is NULL\n\nAny registered clk_core structure can have a NULL pointer in its dev\nfield. While never actually documented, this is evidenced by the wide\nusage of clk_register and clk_hw_register with a NULL device pointer,\nand the fact that the core of_clk_hw_register() function also passes a\nNULL device pointer.\n\nA call to clk_hw_get_clk() on a clk_hw struct whose clk_core is in that\ncase will result in a NULL pointer derefence when it calls dev_name() on\nthat NULL device pointer.\n\nAdd a test for this case and use NULL as the dev_id if the device\npointer is NULL.",
