            "description": "A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to upload or delete files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because of missing authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files into a specific container or delete files from a specific folder within that container. This vulnerability only affects a specific REST API endpoint and does not affect the web-based management interface.",
