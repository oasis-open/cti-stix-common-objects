            "description": "The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them through the sb_login_user_with_otp_fun() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as arbitrary users, including administrators.",
