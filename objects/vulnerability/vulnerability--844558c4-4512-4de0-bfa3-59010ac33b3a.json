            "description": "An issue was discovered in REDCap 14.9.6. It allows HTML Injection via the Survey field name, exposing users to a redirection to a phishing website. An attacker can exploit this to trick the user that receives the survey into clicking on the field name, which redirects them to a phishing website. Thus, this allows malicious actions to be executed without user consent.",
