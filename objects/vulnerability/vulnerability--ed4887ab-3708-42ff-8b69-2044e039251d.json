            "description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in the workflow-checker.yml workflow of significant-gravitas/autogpt. The untrusted user input `github.head.ref` is used insecurely, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. This vulnerability affects versions up to and including the latest version. An attacker can exploit this by creating a branch name with a malicious payload and opening a pull request, potentially leading to reverse shell access or theft of sensitive tokens and keys.",
