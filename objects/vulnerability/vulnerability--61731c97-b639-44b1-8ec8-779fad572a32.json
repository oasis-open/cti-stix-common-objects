            "description": "A Path Traversal vulnerability exists in the `/wipe_database` endpoint of parisneo/lollms version v12, allowing an attacker to delete any directory on the system. The vulnerability arises from improper validation of the `key` parameter, which is used to construct file paths. An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to delete arbitrary directories.",
