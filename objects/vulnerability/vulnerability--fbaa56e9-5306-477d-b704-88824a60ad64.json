            "description": "A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 relay agent of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in a DHCPv6 RELAY-REPLY message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to any IPv6 address that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the dhcp_snoop process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.",
