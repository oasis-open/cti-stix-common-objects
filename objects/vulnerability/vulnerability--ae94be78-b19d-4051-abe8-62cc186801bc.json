            "description": "A Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value vulnerability in the jdhcpd daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS, when DHCP snooping is enabled, allows an unauthenticated, adjacent, attacker to send a DHCP packet with a malformed DHCP option to cause jdhcp to crash creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nContinuous receipt of these DHCP packets using the malformed DHCP Option will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  from 23.1R1 before 23.2R2-S3,\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2-S3,\n  *  from 24.2 before 24.2R2.\n\n\nThis issue isn't applicable to any versions of Junos OS before 23.1R1. \n\n\n\nThis issue doesn't affect vSRX Series which doesn't support DHCP Snooping. \n\nThis issue doesn't affect Junos OS Evolved.\n\nThere are no indicators of compromise for this issue.",
