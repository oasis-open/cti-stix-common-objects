            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: don't revert iter for -EIOCBQUEUED\n\nblkdev_read_iter() has a few odd checks, like gating the position and\ncount adjustment on whether or not the result is bigger-than-or-equal to\nzero (where bigger than makes more sense), and not checking the return\nvalue of blkdev_direct_IO() before doing an iov_iter_revert(). The\nlatter can lead to attempting to revert with a negative value, which\nwhen passed to iov_iter_revert() as an unsigned value will lead to\nthrowing a WARN_ON() because unroll is bigger than MAX_RW_COUNT.\n\nBe sane and don't revert for -EIOCBQUEUED, like what is done in other\nspots.",
