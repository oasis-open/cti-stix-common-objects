            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: seq: Fix function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_event\n\nWith clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),\nindirect call targets are validated against the expected function\npointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate\nROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,\nwhich manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.\n\nseq_copy_in_user() and seq_copy_in_kernel() did not have prototypes\nmatching snd_seq_dump_func_t. Adjust this and remove the casts. There\nare not resulting binary output differences.\n\nThis was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict\nflag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,\nwhich only checks for type width mismatches.",
