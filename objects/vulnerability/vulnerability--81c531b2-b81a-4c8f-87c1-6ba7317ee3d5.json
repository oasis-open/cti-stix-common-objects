            "description": "The Ocean Extra plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.6.5]. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the add_core_extensions_bundle_validation() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to validate extension bundles via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
