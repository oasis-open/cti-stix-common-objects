            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbfq: Update cgroup information before merging bio\n\nWhen the process is migrated to a different cgroup (or in case of\nwriteback just starts submitting bios associated with a different\ncgroup) bfq_merge_bio() can operate with stale cgroup information in\nbic. Thus the bio can be merged to a request from a different cgroup or\nit can result in merging of bfqqs for different cgroups or bfqqs of\nalready dead cgroups and causing possible use-after-free issues. Fix the\nproblem by updating cgroup information in bfq_merge_bio().",
