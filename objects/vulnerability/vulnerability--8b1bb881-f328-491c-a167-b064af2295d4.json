            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlibbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF\n\nIn bpf_objec_load_prog(), there's no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL\nwhen passing it to btf__fd(), and this function does not perform any\ncheck before dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to\ndo). As a consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for\nexample) when trying to load programs that come without BTF information.\n\nv2: Keep btf__fd() in the fix instead of reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().",
