However, since snprintf() returns the\nwould-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length\ncalculation can still go over the given limit.\n\nUse scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually\noutput letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access\nproperly.",
