            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix q->blkg_list corruption during disk rebind\n\nMultiple gendisk instances can allocated/added for single request queue\nin case of disk rebind. blkg may still stay in q->blkg_list when calling\nblkcg_init_disk() for rebind, then q->blkg_list becomes corrupted.\n\nFix the list corruption issue by:\n\n- add blkg_init_queue() to initialize q->blkg_list & q->blkcg_mutex only\n- move calling blkg_init_queue() into blk_alloc_queue()\n\nThe list corruption should be started since commit f1c006f1c685 (\"blk-cgroup:\nsynchronize pd_free_fn() from blkg_free_workfn() and blkcg_deactivate_policy()\")\nwhich delays removing blkg from q->blkg_list into blkg_free_workfn().",
