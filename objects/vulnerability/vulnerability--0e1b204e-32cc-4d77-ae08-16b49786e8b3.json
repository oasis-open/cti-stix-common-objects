            "description": "A vulnerability in the Dockerized version of mintplex-labs/anything-llm (latest, digest 1d9452da2b92) allows for a denial of service. Uploading an audio file with a very low sample rate causes the functionality responsible for transcribing it to crash the entire site instance. The issue arises from the localWhisper implementation, where resampling the audio file from 1 Hz to 16000 Hz quickly exceeds available memory, leading to the Docker instance being killed by the instance manager.",
