            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco&nbsp;ECE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a username enumeration attack against an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to differences in authentication responses that are sent back from the application as part of an authentication attempt. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending authentication requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to confirm existing user accounts, which could be used in further attacks.\r\nCisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
