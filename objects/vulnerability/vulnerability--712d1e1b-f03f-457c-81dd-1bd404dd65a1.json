            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: arm64: Unconditionally save+flush host FPSIMD/SVE/SME state\n\nThere are several problems with the way hyp code lazily saves the host's\nFPSIMD/SVE state, including:\n\n* Host SVE being discarded unexpectedly due to inconsistent\n  configuration of TIF_SVE and CPACR_ELx.ZEN. This has been seen to\n  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by\n  Eric Auger:\n\n  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997\n\n* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an\n  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.\n\n* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,\n  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses\n  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR\n  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale\n  value in memory.\n\nAvoid these by eagerly saving and \"flushing\" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME\nstate when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the\nhost's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is\nremoved and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is\nplaced in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp(). As 'fpsimd_state' and 'fpmr_ptr'\nshould not be used, they are set to NULL; all uses of these will be\nremoved in subsequent patches.\n\nHistorical problems go back at least as far as v5.17, e.g. erroneous\nassumptions about TIF_SVE being clear in commit:\n\n  8383741ab2e773a9 (\"KVM: arm64: Get rid of host SVE tracking/saving\")\n\n... and so this eager save+flush probably needs to be backported to ALL\nstable trees.",
