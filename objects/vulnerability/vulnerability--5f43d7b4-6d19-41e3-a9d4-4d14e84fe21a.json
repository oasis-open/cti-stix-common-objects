            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: prevent panic for nfsv4.0 closed files in nfs4_show_open\n\nPrior to commit 3f29cc82a84c (\"nfsd: split sc_status out of\nsc_type\") states_show() relied on sc_type field to be of valid\ntype before calling into a subfunction to show content of a\nparticular stateid. From that commit, we split the validity of\nthe stateid into sc_status and no longer changed sc_type to 0\nwhile unhashing the stateid. This resulted in kernel oopsing\nfor nfsv4.0 opens that stay around and in nfs4_show_open()\nwould derefence sc_file which was NULL.\n\nInstead, for closed open stateids forgo displaying information\nthat relies of having a valid sc_file.\n\nTo reproduce: mount the server with 4.0, read and close\na file and then on the server cat /proc/fs/nfsd/clients/2/states\n\n[  513.590804] Call trace:\n[  513.590925]  _raw_spin_lock+0xcc/0x160\n[  513.591119]  nfs4_show_open+0x78/0x2c0 [nfsd]\n[  513.591412]  states_show+0x44c/0x488 [nfsd]\n[  513.591681]  seq_read_iter+0x5d8/0x760\n[  513.591896]  seq_read+0x188/0x208\n[  513.592075]  vfs_read+0x148/0x470\n[  513.592241]  ksys_read+0xcc/0x178",
