The timer callback, dl_task_timer,\nis supposed to decrement the reference count upon expiration. However,\nif enqueue_task_dl() is called before the timer expires and cancels it,\nthe reference count is not decremented, leading to the leak.\n\nThis patch fixes the reference leak by ensuring the task_struct\nreference count is properly decremented when the timer is canceled.",
