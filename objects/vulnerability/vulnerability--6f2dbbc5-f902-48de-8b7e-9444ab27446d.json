            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization\n\nThe devlink reload process will access the hardware resources,\nbut the register operation is done before the hardware is initialized.\nSo, processing the devlink reload during initialization may lead to kernel\ncrash. This patch fixes this by taking devl_lock during initialization.",
