IN OpenFGA v1.3.8 to v1.8.2 (Helm chart openfga-0.1.38 to openfga-0.2.19, docker v1.3.8 to v.1.8.2)  are vulnerable to authorization bypass under the following conditions: 1. calling Check API or ListObjects with a model that uses [conditions](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions), and 2. calling Check API or ListObjects API with [contextual tuples](https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-are-contextual-tuples) that include conditions and 3. OpenFGA is configured with caching enabled (`OPENFGA_CHECK_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED`). Users are advised to upgrade to v1.8.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
