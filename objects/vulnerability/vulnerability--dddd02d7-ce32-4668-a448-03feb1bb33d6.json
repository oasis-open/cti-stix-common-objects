            "description": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Compound Document Binary File format parser of the GNOME Project G Structured File Library (libgsf) version v1.14.52. A specially crafted file can result in an integer overflow when processing the directory from the file that allows for an out-of-bounds index to be used when reading and writing to an array. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.",
