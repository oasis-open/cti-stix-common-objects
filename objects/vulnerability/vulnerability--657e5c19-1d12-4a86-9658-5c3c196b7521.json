            "description": "An Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nOn devices with SRv6 (Segment Routing over IPv6) enabled, an attacker can send a malformed BGP UPDATE packet which will cause the rpd to crash and restart. Continued receipt of these UPDATE packets will cause a sustained DoS condition. \n\nThis issue affects iBGP and eBGP, and both IPv4 and IPv6 are affected by this vulnerability.This issue affects Junos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5, \n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2;\n\n\n\nand Junos OS Evolved: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, \n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S5-EVO, \n  *  from 22.3-EVO before 22.3R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
