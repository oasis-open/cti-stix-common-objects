            "description": "A flaw was found in GnuTLS, which relies on libtasn1 for ASN.1 data processing. Due to an inefficient algorithm in libtasn1, decoding certain DER-encoded certificate data can take excessive time, leading to increased resource consumption. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send a specially crafted certificate, causing GnuTLS to become unresponsive or slow, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
