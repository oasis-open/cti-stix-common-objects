            "description": "A vulnerability in the update process of Docker Desktop for Windows versions prior to 4.41.0Â could allow a local, low-privileged attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. During an update, Docker Desktop attempts to delete files and subdirectories under the path C:\\ProgramData\\Docker\\config with high privileges. However, this directory often does not exist by default, and C:\\ProgramData\\ allows normal users to create new directories. By creating a malicious Docker\\config folder structure at this location, an attacker can force the privileged update process to delete or manipulate arbitrary system files, leading to Elevation of Privilege.",
