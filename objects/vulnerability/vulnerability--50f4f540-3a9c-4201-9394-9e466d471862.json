            "description": "The web administration interface in NetModule Router Software (NRSW) 4.6 before 4.6.0.106 and 4.8 before 4.8.0.101 executes an OS command constructed with unsanitized user input: shell metacharacters in the /admin/gnssAutoAlign.php device_id parameter. This occurs because another thread can be started before the trap that triggers the cleanup function. A successful exploit could allow an authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2023-0861 and CVE-2023-0862, which were fixed in version 4.6.0.105.",
