            "description": "A vulnerability was found in Open5GS up to 2.7.2. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function gmm_state_authentication of the file src/amf/gmm-sm.c of the component AMF. The manipulation leads to denial of service. The attack can be launched remotely. This vulnerability allows a single UE to crash the AMF, resulting in the complete loss of mobility and session management services and causing a network-wide outage. All registered UEs will lose connectivity, and new registrations will be blocked until the AMF is restarted, leading to a high availability impact. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The patch is named e31e9965f00d9c744a7f728497cb4f3e97744ee8. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue.",
