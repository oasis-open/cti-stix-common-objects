            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nftruncate: pass a signed offset\n\nThe old ftruncate() syscall, using the 32-bit off_t misses a sign\nextension when called in compat mode on 64-bit architectures.  As a\nresult, passing a negative length accidentally succeeds in truncating\nto file size between 2GiB and 4GiB.\n\nChanging the type of the compat syscall to the signed compat_off_t\nchanges the behavior so it instead returns -EINVAL.\n\nThe native entry point, the truncate() syscall and the corresponding\nloff_t based variants are all correct already and do not suffer\nfrom this mistake.",
