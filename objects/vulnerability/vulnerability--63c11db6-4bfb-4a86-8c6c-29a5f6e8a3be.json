            "description": "Vanna-ai v0.6.2 is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient protection against injecting additional SQL commands from user requests. The vulnerability occurs when the `generate_sql` function calls `extract_sql` with the LLM response. An attacker can include a semi-colon between a search data field and their own command, causing the `extract_sql` function to remove all LLM generated SQL and execute the attacker's command if it passes the `is_sql_valid` function. This allows the execution of user-defined SQL beyond the expected boundaries, notably the trained schema.",
