            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: ethernet: lantiq_etop: fix memory disclosure\n\nWhen applying padding, the buffer is not zeroed, which results in memory\ndisclosure. The mentioned data is observed on the wire. This patch uses\nskb_put_padto() to pad Ethernet frames properly. The mentioned function\nzeroes the expanded buffer.\n\nIn case the packet cannot be padded it is silently dropped. Statistics\nare also not incremented. This driver does not support statistics in the\nold 32-bit format or the new 64-bit format. These will be added in the\nfuture. In its current form, the patch should be easily backported to\nstable versions.\n\nEthernet MACs on Amazon-SE and Danube cannot do padding of the packets\nin hardware, so software padding must be applied.",
