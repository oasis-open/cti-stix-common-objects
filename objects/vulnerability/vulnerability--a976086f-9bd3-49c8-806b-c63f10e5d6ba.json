            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nrcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq\n\nAfter a CPU has set itself offline and before it eventually calls\nrcutree_report_cpu_dead(), there are still opportunities for callbacks\nto be enqueued, for example from a softirq. When that happens on NOCB,\nthe rcuog wake-up is deferred through an IPI to an online CPU in order\nnot to call into the scheduler and risk arming the RT-bandwidth after\nhrtimers have been migrated out and disabled.\n\nBut performing a synchronized IPI from a softirq is buggy as reported in\nthe following scenario:\n\n        WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 26 at kernel/smp.c:633 smp_call_function_single\n        Modules linked in: rcutorture torture\n        CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 26 Comm: migration/1 Not tainted 6.11.0-rc1-00012-g9139f93209d1 #1\n        Stopper: multi_cpu_stop+0x0/0x320 <- __stop_cpus+0xd0/0x120\n        RIP: 0010:smp_call_function_single\n        <IRQ>\n        swake_up_one_online\n        __call_rcu_nocb_wake\n        __call_rcu_common\n        ? rcu_torture_one_read\n        call_timer_fn\n        __run_timers\n        run_timer_softirq\n        handle_softirqs\n        irq_exit_rcu\n        ? tick_handle_periodic\n        sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt\n        </IRQ>\n\nFix this with forcing deferred rcuog wake up through the NOCB timer when\nthe CPU is offline. The actual wake up will happen from\nrcutree_report_cpu_dead().",
