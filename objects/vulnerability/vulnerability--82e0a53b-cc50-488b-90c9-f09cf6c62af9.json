            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Multiplatform Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary commands as the root user on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.",
