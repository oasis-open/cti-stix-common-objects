            "description": "Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20. A temporary workaround involves disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules.",
