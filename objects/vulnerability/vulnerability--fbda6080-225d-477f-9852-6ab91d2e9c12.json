            "description": "Via the GUI of the \"bestinformed Infoclient\", a low-privileged user is by default able to change the server address of the \"bestinformed Server\" to which this client connects. This is dangerous as the \"bestinformed Infoclient\" runs with elevated permissions (\"nt authority\\system\"). By changing the server address to a malicious server, or a script simulating a server, the user is able to escalate his privileges by abusing certain features of the \"bestinformed Web\" server. Those features include:\n  *  Pushing of malicious update packages\n  *  Arbitrary Registry Read as \"nt authority\\system\"\n\n\nAn attacker is able to escalate his privileges to \"nt authority\\system\" on the Windows client running the \"bestinformed Infoclient\". \n\n\nThis attack is not possible if a custom configuration (\"Infoclient.ini\") containing the flags \"ShowOnTaskbar=false\" or \"DisabledItems=stPort,stAddress\" is deployed.",
