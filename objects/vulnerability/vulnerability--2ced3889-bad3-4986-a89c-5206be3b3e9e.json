            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets\n\nThe blamed commit disabled hardware offoad of IPv6 packets with\nextension headers on devices that advertise NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM,\nbased on the definition of that feature in skbuff.h:\n\n *   * - %NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM\n *     - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain\n *       TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically\n *       unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or\n *       IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6\n *       header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers\n *       are not supported with this feature. This feature\n *       cannot be set in features for a device with\n *       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being\n *       DEPRECATED (see below).\n\nThe change causes skb_warn_bad_offload to fire for BIG TCP\npackets.\n\n[  496.310233] WARNING: CPU: 13 PID: 23472 at net/core/dev.c:3129 skb_warn_bad_offload+0xc4/0xe0\n\n[  496.310297]  ? skb_warn_bad_offload+0xc4/0xe0\n[  496.310300]  skb_checksum_help+0x129/0x1f0\n[  496.310303]  skb_csum_hwoffload_help+0x150/0x1b0\n[  496.310306]  validate_xmit_skb+0x159/0x270\n[  496.310309]  validate_xmit_skb_list+0x41/0x70\n[  496.310312]  sch_direct_xmit+0x5c/0x250\n[  496.310317]  __qdisc_run+0x388/0x620\n\nBIG TCP introduced an IPV6_TLV_JUMBO IPv6 extension header to\ncommunicate packet length, as this is an IPv6 jumbogram. But, the\nfeature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The\nheader is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not\ntransmitted by physical devices.\n\nFor this specific case of extension headers that are not\ntransmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit\nand support hardware offload.\n\nipv6_has_hopopt_jumbo() tests not only whether this header is present,\nbut also that it is the only extension header before a terminal (L4)\nheader.",
