            "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a BGP UPDATE with malformed path attribute is received over an established BGP session, rpd crashes and restarts. \n\nContinuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n Juniper Networks Junos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2, 23.4R2.\n\n\n Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: \n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S2-EVO, 23.4R2-EVO.",
