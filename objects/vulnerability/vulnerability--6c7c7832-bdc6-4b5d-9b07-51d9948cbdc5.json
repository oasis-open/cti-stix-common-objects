            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk\n\nread_balance() will avoid reading from slow disks as much as possible,\nhowever, if valid data only lands in slow disks, and a new normal disk\nis still in recovery, unrecovered data can be read:\n\nraid1_read_request\n read_balance\n  raid1_should_read_first\n  -> return false\n  choose_best_rdev\n  -> normal disk is not recovered, return -1\n  choose_bb_rdev\n  -> missing the checking of recovery, return the normal disk\n -> read unrecovered data\n\nRoot cause is that the checking of recovery is missing in\nchoose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.\n\nAlso fix similar problem in choose_slow_rdev().",
