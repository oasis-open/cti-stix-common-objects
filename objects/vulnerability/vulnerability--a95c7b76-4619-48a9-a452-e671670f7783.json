            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npinctrl: intel: platform: fix error path in device_for_each_child_node()\n\nThe device_for_each_child_node() loop requires calls to\nfwnode_handle_put() upon early returns to decrement the refcount of\nthe child node and avoid leaking memory if that error path is triggered.\n\nThere is one early returns within that loop in\nintel_platform_pinctrl_prepare_community(), but fwnode_handle_put() is\nmissing.\n\nInstead of adding the missing call, the scoped version of the loop can\nbe used to simplify the code and avoid mistakes in the future if new\nearly returns are added, as the child node is only used for parsing, and\nit is never assigned.",
