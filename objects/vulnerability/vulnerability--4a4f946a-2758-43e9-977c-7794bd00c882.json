            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfsnotify: Fix ordering of iput() and watched_objects decrement\n\nEnsure the superblock is kept alive until we're done with iput().\nHolding a reference to an inode is not allowed unless we ensure the\nsuperblock stays alive, which fsnotify does by keeping the\nwatched_objects count elevated, so iput() must happen before the\nwatched_objects decrement.\nThis can lead to a UAF of something like sb->s_fs_info in tmpfs, but the\nUAF is hard to hit because race orderings that oops are more likely, thanks\nto the CHECK_DATA_CORRUPTION() block in generic_shutdown_super().\n\nAlso, ensure that fsnotify_put_sb_watched_objects() doesn't call\nfsnotify_sb_watched_objects() on a superblock that may have already been\nfreed, which would cause a UAF read of sb->s_fsnotify_info.",
