            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix use-after-free in SMB request handling\n\nA race condition exists between SMB request handling in\n`ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` and the freeing of `ksmbd_conn` in the\nworkqueue handler `handle_ksmbd_work()`. This leads to a UAF.\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free Read in handle_ksmbd_work\n- KASAN: slab-use-after-free in rtlock_slowlock_locked\n\nThis race condition arises as follows:\n- `ksmbd_conn_handler_loop()` waits for `conn->r_count` to reach zero:\n  `wait_event(conn->r_count_q, atomic_read(&conn->r_count) == 0);`\n- Meanwhile, `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count` using\n  `atomic_dec_return(&conn->r_count)`, and if it reaches zero, calls\n  `ksmbd_conn_free()`, which frees `conn`.\n- However, after `handle_ksmbd_work()` decrements `conn->r_count`,\n  it may still access `conn->r_count_q` in the following line:\n  `waitqueue_active(&conn->r_count_q)` or `wake_up(&conn->r_count_q)`\n  This results in a UAF, as `conn` has already been freed.\n\nThe discovery of this UAF can be referenced in the following PR for\nsyzkaller's support for SMB requests.",
