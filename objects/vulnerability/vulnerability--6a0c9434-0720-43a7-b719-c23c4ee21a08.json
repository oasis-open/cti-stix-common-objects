            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmd/raid1,raid10: don't ignore IO flags\n\nIf blk-wbt is enabled by default, it's found that raid write performance\nis quite bad because all IO are throttled by wbt of underlying disks,\ndue to flag REQ_IDLE is ignored. And turns out this behaviour exist since\nblk-wbt is introduced.\n\nOther than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for\nexample REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority\nreverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because\nio will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.\n\nFix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.\n\nFises: f51d46d0e7cb (\"md: add support for REQ_NOWAIT\")",
