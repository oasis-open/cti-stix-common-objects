            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup\n\nlookup and resize can run in parallel.\n\nThe xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash\nfunctions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist\narray.\n\nrehash does:\n  rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]\n  net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;\n\nWhile state lookup does:\n  h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);\n  hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {\n\nThis is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than\nnet->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets\nserialized via state spinlock again).\n\nFix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.\nThe xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer\nand the hmask will be consistent.\n\nThe existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,\nadd lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert\nside.\n\nxfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU.\nAFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to\nRCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.",
