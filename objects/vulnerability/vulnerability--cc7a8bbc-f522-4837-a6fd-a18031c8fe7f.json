            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting in conntrack\"\n\nCurrently, ovs_ct_set_labels() is only called for confirmed conntrack\nentries (ct) within ovs_ct_commit(). However, if the conntrack entry\ndoes not have the labels_ext extension, attempting to allocate it in\novs_ct_get_conn_labels() for a confirmed entry triggers a warning in\nnf_ct_ext_add():\n\n  WARN_ON(nf_ct_is_confirmed(ct));\n\nThis happens when the conntrack entry is created externally before OVS\nincrements net->ct.labels_used. The issue has become more likely since\ncommit fcb1aa5163b1 (\"openvswitch: switch to per-action label counting\nin conntrack\"), which changed to use per-action label counting and\nincrement net->ct.labels_used when a flow with ct action is added.\n\nSince thereâ€™s no straightforward way to fully resolve this issue at the\nmoment, this reverts the commit to avoid breaking existing use cases.",
