            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch->limit == 0\n\nExpected behaviour:\nIn case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a\npacket in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.\nThen, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase\nscheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return\n`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nWeird behaviour:\nIn case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a\nscheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.\nThis means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.\nThen, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by\none. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by\none and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.\n\nThe problem is:\nLet's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.\n - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.\n   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.\n - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.\n - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.\n\nEnqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:\n - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)\n - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1\n - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`\n - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.\n\nThe whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.\nReplace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.\nThis violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.\n\nBug impact: This issue can be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.",
