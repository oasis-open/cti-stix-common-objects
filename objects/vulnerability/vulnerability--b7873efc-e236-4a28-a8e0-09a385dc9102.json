            "description": "Cloudburst Network provides network components used within Cloudburst projects. A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library.",
