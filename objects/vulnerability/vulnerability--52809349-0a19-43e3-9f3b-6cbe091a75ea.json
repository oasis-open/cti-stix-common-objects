            "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), which causes the l2cpd process to crash by sending a specific TLV.\n\nThe l2cpd process is responsible for layer 2 control protocols, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP, VSTP, ERP, and LLDP.  The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP, leading to a Denial of Service.  Continued receipt and processing of this specific TLV will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \nall versions before 20.4R3-S9, \nfrom 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, \nfrom 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5, \nfrom 21.4 before 21.4R3-S4, \nfrom 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4, \nfrom 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2, \nfrom 22.3 before 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3-S1, \nfrom 22.4 before 22.4R2-S2, 22.4R3, \nfrom 23.2 before 23.2R1-S1, 23.2R2;\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \nall versions before 21.2R3-S7,\n\n \nfrom 21.3 before 21.3R3-S5-EVO, \nfrom 21.4 before 21.4R3-S5-EVO, \nfrom 22.1 before 22.1R3-S4-EVO, \nfrom 22.2 before 22.2R3-S2-EVO, \nfrom 22.3 before 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO, \nfrom 22.4 before 22.4R2-S2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO, \nfrom 23.2 before 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.\n\n",
