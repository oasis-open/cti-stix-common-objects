            "description": "A vulnerability in the hybrid access control list (ACL) processing of IPv4 packets in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of packets when a specific configuration of the hybrid ACL exists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured ACL on the affected device.\r\nFor more information, see the  section of this advisory.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
