            "description": "Magento Long Term Support (LTS) is an unofficial, community-driven project provides an alternative to the Magento Community Edition e-commerce platform with a high level of backward compatibility. Versions prior to 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a vulnerability that allows script execution in the admin panel which could lead to cross-site scripting against authenticated admin users. The attack requires an admin user with configuration access, so in practicality it is not very likely to be useful given that a user with this level of access is probably already a full admin. Versions 20.12.3 and 20.13.1 contain a patch for the issue.",
