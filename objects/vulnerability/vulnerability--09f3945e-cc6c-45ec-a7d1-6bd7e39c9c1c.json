            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet_sched: hfsc: Fix a UAF vulnerability in class handling\n\nThis patch fixes a Use-After-Free vulnerability in the HFSC qdisc class\nhandling. The issue occurs due to a time-of-check/time-of-use condition\nin hfsc_change_class() when working with certain child qdiscs like netem\nor codel.\n\nThe vulnerability works as follows:\n1. hfsc_change_class() checks if a class has packets (q.qlen != 0)\n2. It then calls qdisc_peek_len(), which for certain qdiscs (e.g.,\n   codel, netem) might drop packets and empty the queue\n3. The code continues assuming the queue is still non-empty, adding\n   the class to vttree\n4. This breaks HFSC scheduler assumptions that only non-empty classes\n   are in vttree\n5. Later, when the class is destroyed, this can lead to a Use-After-Free\n\nThe fix adds a second queue length check after qdisc_peek_len() to verify\nthe queue wasn't emptied.",
