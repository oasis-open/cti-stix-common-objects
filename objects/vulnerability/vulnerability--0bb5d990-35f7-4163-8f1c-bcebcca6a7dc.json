            "description": "A command injection vulnerability in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS OpenConfig plugin enables an authenticated administrator with the ability to make gNMI requests to the PAN-OS management web interface to bypass system restrictions and run arbitrary commands. The commands are run as the “__openconfig” user (which has the Device Administrator role) on the firewall.\n\nYou can greatly reduce the risk of this issue by restricting access to the management web interface to only trusted internal IP addresses according to our recommended  best practices deployment guidelines https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/community-blogs/tips-amp-tricks-how-to-secure-the-management-access-of-your-palo/ba-p/464431 .",
