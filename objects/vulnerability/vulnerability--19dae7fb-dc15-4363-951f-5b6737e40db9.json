            "description": "GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. An integer underflow has been detected in extract_cc_from_data function within qtdemux.c. In the FOURCC_c708 case, the subtraction atom_length - 8 may result in an underflow if atom_length is less than 8. When that subtraction underflows, *cclen ends up being a large number, and then cclen is passed to g_memdup2 leading to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.24.10.",
