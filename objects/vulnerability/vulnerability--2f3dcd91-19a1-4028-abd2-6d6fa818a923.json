            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/xe: Fix tlb invalidation when wedging\n\nIf GuC fails to load, the driver wedges, but in the process it tries to\ndo stuff that may not be initialized yet. This moves the\nxe_gt_tlb_invalidation_init() to be done earlier: as its own doc says,\nit's a software-only initialization and should had been named with the\n_early() suffix.\n\nMove it to be called by xe_gt_init_early(), so the locks and seqno are\ninitialized, avoiding a NULL ptr deref when wedging:\n\n\txe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: load failed: status: Reset = 0, BootROM = 0x50, UKernel = 0x00, MIA = 0x00, Auth = 0x01\n\txe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* GT0: firmware signature verification failed\n\txe 0000:03:00.0: [drm] *ERROR* CRITICAL: Xe has declared device 0000:03:00.0 as wedged.\n\t...\n\tBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000\n\t#PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n\t#PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n\tPGD 0 P4D 0\n\tOops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\n\tCPU: 9 UID: 0 PID: 3908 Comm: modprobe Tainted: G     U  W          6.13.0-rc4-xe+ #3\n\tTainted: [U]=USER, [W]=WARN\n\tHardware name: Intel Corporation Alder Lake Client Platform/AlderLake-S ADP-S DDR5 UDIMM CRB, BIOS ADLSFWI1.R00.3275.A00.2207010640 07/01/2022\n\tRIP: 0010:xe_gt_tlb_invalidation_reset+0x75/0x110 [xe]\n\nThis can be easily triggered by poking the GuC binary to force a\nsignature failure.
