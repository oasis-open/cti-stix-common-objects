            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\n9p/trans_fd: always use O_NONBLOCK read/write\n\nsyzbot is reporting hung task at p9_fd_close() [1], for p9_mux_poll_stop()\n from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is failing to interrupt already\nstarted kernel_read() from p9_fd_read() from p9_read_work() and/or\nkernel_write() from p9_fd_write() from p9_write_work() requests.\n\nSince p9_socket_open() sets O_NONBLOCK flag, p9_mux_poll_stop() does not\nneed to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write(). However, since p9_fd_open()\ndoes not set O_NONBLOCK flag, but pipe blocks unless signal is pending,\np9_mux_poll_stop() needs to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() when\nthe file descriptor refers to a pipe. In other words, pipe file descriptor\nneeds to be handled as if socket file descriptor.\n\nWe somehow need to interrupt kernel_read()/kernel_write() on pipes.\n\nA minimal change, which this patch is doing, is to set O_NONBLOCK flag\n from p9_fd_open(), for O_NONBLOCK flag does not affect reading/writing\nof regular files. But this approach changes O_NONBLOCK flag on userspace-\nsupplied file descriptors (which might break userspace programs), and\nO_NONBLOCK flag could be changed by userspace. It would be possible to set\nO_NONBLOCK flag every time p9_fd_read()/p9_fd_write() is invoked, but still\nremains small race window for clearing O_NONBLOCK flag.\n\nIf we don't want to manipulate O_NONBLOCK flag, we might be able to\nsurround kernel_read()/kernel_write() with set_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)\nand recalc_sigpending(). Since p9_read_work()/p9_write_work() works are\nprocessed by kernel threads which process global system_wq workqueue,\nsignals could not be delivered from remote threads when p9_mux_poll_stop()\n from p9_conn_destroy() from p9_fd_close() is called. Therefore, calling\nset_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING)/recalc_sigpending() every time would be\nneeded if we count on signals for making kernel_read()/kernel_write()\nnon-blocking.\n\n[Dominique: add comment at Christian's suggestion]",
