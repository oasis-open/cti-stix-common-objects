            "description": "A vulnerability in the binary-husky/gpt_academic repository, as of commit git 3890467, allows an attacker to crash the server by uploading a specially crafted zip bomb. The server decompresses the uploaded file and attempts to load it into memory, which can lead to an out-of-memory crash. This issue arises due to improper input validation when handling compressed file uploads.",
