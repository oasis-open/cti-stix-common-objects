            "description": "The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java and JVM-based applications to connect to and interact with RabbitMQ nodes. `maxBodyLebgth` was not used when receiving Message objects.  Attackers could send a very large Message causing a memory overflow and triggering an OOM Error. Users of RabbitMQ may suffer from  DoS attacks from RabbitMQ Java client which will ultimately exhaust the memory of the consumer. This vulnerability was patched in version 5.18.0.",
