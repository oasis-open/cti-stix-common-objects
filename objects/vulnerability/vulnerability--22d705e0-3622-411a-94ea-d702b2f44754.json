            "description": "The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the jobsearch_wp_handle_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
