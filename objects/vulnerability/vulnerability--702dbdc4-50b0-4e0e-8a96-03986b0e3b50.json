            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntls: fix use-after-free on failed backlog decryption\n\nWhen the decrypt request goes to the backlog and crypto_aead_decrypt\nreturns -EBUSY, tls_do_decryption will wait until all async\ndecryptions have completed. If one of them fails, tls_do_decryption\nwill return -EBADMSG and tls_decrypt_sg jumps to the error path,\nreleasing all the pages. But the pages have been passed to the async\ncallback, and have already been released by tls_decrypt_done.\n\nThe only true async case is when crypto_aead_decrypt returns\n -EINPROGRESS. With -EBUSY, we already waited so we can tell\ntls_sw_recvmsg that the data is available for immediate copy, but we\nneed to notify tls_decrypt_sg (via the new ->async_done flag) that the\nmemory has already been released.",
