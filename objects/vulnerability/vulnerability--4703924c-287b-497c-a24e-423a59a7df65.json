            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not sufficiently validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface on an affected system to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
