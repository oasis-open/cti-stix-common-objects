            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nHID: intel-ish-hid: Fix use-after-free issue in ishtp_hid_remove()\n\nThe system can experience a random crash a few minutes after the driver is\nremoved. This issue occurs due to improper handling of memory freeing in\nthe ishtp_hid_remove() function.\n\nThe function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop\nthat destroys the HID devices, which can lead to accessing freed memory.\nSpecifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls\n`hid_ishtp_set_feature()` to power off the sensor, so freeing\n`driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.\n\nThis patch resolves the issue by storing the `driver_data` in a temporary\nvariable before calling `hid_destroy_device()`, and then freeing the\n`driver_data` after the device is destroyed.",
