            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/pseries/iommu: LPAR panics during boot up with a frozen PE\n\nAt the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware\nproperty ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI\nbus the PE is attached to.\n\nThere are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this\nproperty for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is\nwhere the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This\nPE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.\n\nWithin this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be\npresented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.\n\nToday, under these circumstances, the LPAR oopses with NULL pointer\ndereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.\n\n  BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x000000c8\n  Faulting instruction address: 0xc0000000001024c0\n  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 7 [#1]\n  LE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Radix SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA pSeries\n  Modules linked in:\n  Supported: Yes\n  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.4.0-150600.9-default #1\n  Hardware name: IBM,9043-MRX POWER10 (raw) 0x800200 0xf000006 of:IBM,FW1060.00 (NM1060_023) hv:phyp pSeries\n  NIP:  c0000000001024c0 LR: c0000000001024b0 CTR: c000000000102450\n  REGS: c0000000037db5c0 TRAP: 0300   Not tainted  (6.4.0-150600.9-default)\n  MSR:  8000000002009033 <SF,VEC,EE,ME,IR,DR,RI,LE>  CR: 28000822  XER: 00000000\n  CFAR: c00000000010254c DAR: 00000000000000c8 DSISR: 00080000 IRQMASK: 0\n  ...\n  NIP [c0000000001024c0] pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP+0x70/0x2a0\n  LR [c0000000001024b0] pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP+0x60/0x2a0\n  Call Trace:\n    pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeriesLP+0x60/0x2a0 (unreliable)\n    pcibios_setup_bus_self+0x1c0/0x370\n    __of_scan_bus+0x2f8/0x330\n    pcibios_scan_phb+0x280/0x3d0\n    pcibios_init+0x88/0x12c\n    do_one_initcall+0x60/0x320\n    kernel_init_freeable+0x344/0x3e4\n    kernel_init+0x34/0x1d0\n    ret_from_kernel_user_thread+0x14/0x1c",
