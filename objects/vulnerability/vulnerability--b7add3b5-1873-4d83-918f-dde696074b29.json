Prior to version 2.0-M5, the preloaded data as json is not escaped correctly, the administrator / event admin could break their own install by inserting non correctly escaped text. The Content-Security-Policy directive blocks any potential script execution. The administrator or event administrator can override the texts for customization purpose.
