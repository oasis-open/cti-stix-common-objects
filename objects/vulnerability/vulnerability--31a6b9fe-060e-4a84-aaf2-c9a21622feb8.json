            "description": "A vulnerability in the vDaemon service of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected system, resulting in a&nbsp;denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete bounds checks for data that is provided to the vDaemon service of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to the vDaemon listening service on the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the affected system, which could allow the attacker to cause the vDaemon listening service to reload and result in a DoS condition.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
