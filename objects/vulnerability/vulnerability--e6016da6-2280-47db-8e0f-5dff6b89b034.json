            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen: use correct end address of kernel for conflict checking\n\nWhen running as a Xen PV dom0 the kernel is loaded by the hypervisor\nusing a different memory map than that of the host. In order to\nminimize the required changes in the kernel, the kernel adapts its\nmemory map to that of the host. In order to do that it is checking\nfor conflicts of its load address with the host memory map.\n\nUnfortunately the tested memory range does not include the .brk\narea, which might result in crashes or memory corruption when this\narea does conflict with the memory map of the host.\n\nFix the test by using the _end label instead of __bss_stop.",
