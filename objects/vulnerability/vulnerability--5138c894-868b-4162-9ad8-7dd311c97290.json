            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel: Limit the period on Haswell\n\nRunning the ltp test cve-2015-3290 concurrently reports the following\nwarnings.\n\nperfevents: irq loop stuck!\n  WARNING: CPU: 31 PID: 32438 at arch/x86/events/intel/core.c:3174\n  intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n  Call Trace:\n   <NMI>\n   ? __warn+0xa4/0x220\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? __report_bug+0x123/0x130\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   ? report_bug+0x3e/0xa0\n   ? handle_bug+0x3c/0x70\n   ? exc_invalid_op+0x18/0x50\n   ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1a/0x20\n   ? irq_work_claim+0x1e/0x40\n   ? intel_pmu_handle_irq+0x285/0x370\n   perf_event_nmi_handler+0x3d/0x60\n   nmi_handle+0x104/0x330\n\nThanks to Thomas Gleixner's analysis, the issue is caused by the low\ninitial period (1) of the frequency estimation algorithm, which triggers\nthe defects of the HW, specifically erratum HSW11 and HSW143. (For the\ndetails, please refer https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87plq9l5d2.ffs@tglx/)\n\nThe HSW11 requires a period larger than 100 for the INST_RETIRED.ALL\nevent, but the initial period in the freq mode is 1. The erratum is the\nsame as the BDM11, which has been supported in the kernel. A minimum\nperiod of 128 is enforced as well on HSW.\n\nHSW143 is regarding that the fixed counter 1 may overcount 32 with the\nHyper-Threading is enabled. However, based on the test, the hardware\nhas more issues than it tells. Besides the fixed counter 1, the message\n'interrupt took too long' can be observed on any counter which was armed\nwith a period < 32 and two events expired in the same NMI. A minimum\nperiod of 32 is enforced for the rest of the events.\nThe recommended workaround code of the HSW143 is not implemented.\nBecause it only addresses the issue for the fixed counter. It brings\nextra overhead through extra MSR writing. No related overcounting issue\nhas been reported so far.",
