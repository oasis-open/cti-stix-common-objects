While the read\nis safe when @from_cancel, @work->data was read before testing @from_cancel\nto simplify code structure:\n\n\tdata = *work_data_bits(work);\n\tif (from_cancel &&\n\t    !WARN_ON_ONCE(data & WORK_STRUCT_PWQ) && (data & WORK_OFFQ_BH)) {\n\nWhile the read data was never used if !@from_cancel, this could trigger\nKCSAN data race detection spuriously:\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KCSAN: data-race in __flush_work / __flush_work\n\n  write to 0xffff8881223aa3e8 of 8 bytes by task 3998 on cpu 0:\n   instrument_write include/linux/instrumented.h:41 [inline]\n   ___set_bit include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-non-atomic.h:28 [inline]\n   insert_wq_barrier kernel/workqueue.c:3790 [inline]\n   start_flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4142 [inline]\n   __flush_work+0x30b/0x570 kernel/workqueue.c:4178\n   flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4229 [inline]\n   ...\n\n  read to 0xffff8881223aa3e8 of 8 bytes by task 50 on cpu 1:\n   __flush_work+0x42a/0x570 kernel/workqueue.c:4188\n   flush_work kernel/workqueue.c:4229 [inline]\n   flush_delayed_work+0x66/0x70 kernel/workqueue.c:4251\n   ...\n\n  value changed: 0x0000000000400000 -> 0xffff88810006c00d\n\nReorganize the code so that @from_cancel is tested before @work->data is\naccessed.
