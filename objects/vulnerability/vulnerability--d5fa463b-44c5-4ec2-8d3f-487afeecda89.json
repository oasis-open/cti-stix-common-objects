            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: pciehp: Fix infinite loop in IRQ handler upon power fault\n\nThe Power Fault Detected bit in the Slot Status register differs from\nall other hotplug events in that it is sticky:  It can only be cleared\nafter turning off slot power.  Per PCIe r5.0, sec. 6.7.1.8:\n\n  If a power controller detects a main power fault on the hot-plug slot,\n  it must automatically set its internal main power fault latch [...].\n  The main power fault latch is cleared when software turns off power to\n  the hot-plug slot.\n\nThe stickiness used to cause interrupt storms and infinite loops which\nwere fixed in 2009 by commits 5651c48cfafe (\"PCI pciehp: fix power fault\ninterrupt storm problem\") and 99f0169c17f3 (\"PCI: pciehp: enable\nsoftware notification on empty slots\").\n\nUnfortunately in 2020 the infinite loop issue was inadvertently\nreintroduced by commit 8edf5332c393 (\"PCI: pciehp: Fix MSI interrupt\nrace\"):  The hardirq handler pciehp_isr() clears the PFD bit until\npciehp's power_fault_detected flag is set.  That happens in the IRQ\nthread pciehp_ist(), which never learns of the event because the hardirq\nhandler is stuck in an infinite loop.  Fix by setting the\npower_fault_detected flag already in the hardirq handler.",
