            "description": "\nOn boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content of\n“/config/GlobalConfig/global.json”.\n\nIf the file exists, it overrides the existing configuration on the device on boot.\n\nThis allows an attacker to change the system’s configuration, which also includes some\ndebug functions.\n\nThis could be used to unlock the ssh with custom “authorized_keys” via the\n“debug.enable.ssh” key, similar to the “authorized_keys” finding that was noted before.\n\nOther usages include unlocking the usb to enable the keyboard via the “debug.enable.usb”\nkey, allowing VNC access via the “app.allow.vnc” key, and more.\n\nAn attacker could easily enable these debug functionalities without triggering the “measured\nboot” mechanism implemented by EVE OS, and without marking the device as “UUD”\n(“Unknown Update Detected”).\nThis is because the “/config” partition is not protected by “measured boot”, it is mutable and it\nis not encrypted in any way.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the PCR values, thereby not\ntriggering the “measured boot” mechanism, and having full access to the vault.\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThis issue was partially fixed in these commits (after disclosure to Zededa), where the config\npartition measurement was added to PCR13:\n\n• aa3501d6c57206ced222c33aea15a9169d629141\n\n• 5fef4d92e75838cc78010edaed5247dfbdae1889.\n\nThis issue was made viable in version 9.0.0 when the calculation was moved to PCR14 but it was not included in the measured boot.",
