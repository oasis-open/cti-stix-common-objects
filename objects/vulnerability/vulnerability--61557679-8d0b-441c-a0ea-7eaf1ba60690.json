            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/eevdf: Prevent vlag from going out of bounds in reweight_eevdf()\n\nIt was possible to have pick_eevdf() return NULL, which then causes a\nNULL-deref. This turned out to be due to entity_eligible() returning\nfalsely negative because of a s64 multiplcation overflow.\n\nSpecifically, reweight_eevdf() computes the vlag without considering\nthe limit placed upon vlag as update_entity_lag() does, and then the\nscaling multiplication (remember that weight is 20bit fixed point) can\noverflow. This then leads to the new vruntime being weird which then\ncauses the above entity_eligible() to go side-ways and claim nothing\nis eligible.\n\nThus limit the range of vlag accordingly.\n\nAll this was quite rare, but fatal when it does happen.",
