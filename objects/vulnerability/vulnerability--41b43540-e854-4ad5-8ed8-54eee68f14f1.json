            "description": "Develocity (formerly Gradle Enterprise) before 2024.3.1 allows an attacker who has network access to a Develocity server to obtain the hashed password of the system user. The hash algorithm used by Develocity was chosen according to best practices for password storage and provides some protection against brute-force attempts. The applicable severity of this vulnerability depends on whether a Develocity server is accessible by external or unauthorized users, and the complexity of the System User password.",
