            "description": "A vulnerability in the Admin portal of Cisco&nbsp;Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to recover service account passwords that are saved on an affected system.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect inclusion of saved passwords when loading configuration pages in the Admin portal. An attacker with read or write access to the Admin portal could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to recover passwords and expose those accounts to further attack.Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
