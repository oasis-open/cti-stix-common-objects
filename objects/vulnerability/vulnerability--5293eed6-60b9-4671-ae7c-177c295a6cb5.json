            "description": "libcurl's URL API function\n[curl_url_get()](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_url_get.html) offers punycode\nconversions, to and from IDN. Asking to convert a name that is exactly 256\nbytes, libcurl ends up reading outside of a stack based buffer when built to\nuse the *macidn* IDN backend. The conversion function then fills up the\nprovided buffer exactly - but does not null terminate the string.\n\nThis flaw can lead to stack contents accidently getting returned as part of\nthe converted string.",
