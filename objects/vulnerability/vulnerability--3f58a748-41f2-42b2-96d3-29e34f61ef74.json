            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/netlink: Prevent userspace segmentation fault by adjusting UAPI header\n\nThe intel-lpmd tool [1], which uses the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY\nattribute to receive HFI events from kernel space, encounters a\nsegmentation fault after commit 1773572863c4 (\"thermal: netlink: Add the\ncommands and the events for the thresholds\").\n\nThe issue arises because the THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY raw value\nwas changed while intel_lpmd still uses the old value.\n\nAlthough intel_lpmd can be updated to check the THERMAL_GENL_VERSION and\nuse the appropriate THERMAL_GENL_ATTR_CPU_CAPABILITY value, the commit\nitself is questionable.\n\nThe commit introduced a new element in the middle of enum thermal_genl_attr,\nwhich affects many existing attributes and introduces potential risks\nand unnecessary maintenance burdens for userspace thermal netlink event\nusers.\n\nSolve the issue by moving the newly introduced\nTHERMAL_GENL_ATTR_TZ_PREV_TEMP attribute to the end of the\nenum thermal_genl_attr. This ensures that all existing thermal generic\nnetlink attributes remain unaffected.\n\n[ rjw: Subject edits ]",
