            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nacpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl\n\nFix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:\n\nBUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/\ncore.c:416 [inline]\nBUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0\ndrivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459\n\nThe issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2\narray is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer\nthat is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead\nto out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not\nhave sufficient space.\n\nTo address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that\nbuf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)\nbefore accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of\ncall_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.",
