            "description": "A Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\nWhen an attacker sends a specific ICMPv6 packet to an interface with \"protocols router-advertisement\" configured, rpd crashes and restarts. Continued receipt of this packet will cause a sustained DoS condition. \n\n\n\n\nThis issue only affects systems configured with IPv6.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS: \n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9, \n  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S10, \n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S6, \n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S4, \n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2, \n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2; \n\n\n\nand Junos OS Evolved: \n  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S9-EVO, \n  *  from 21.4-EVO before 21.4R3-S10-EVO, \n  *  from 22.2-EVO before 22.2R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  from 22.4-EVO before 22.4R3-S4-EVO, \n  *  from 23.2-EVO before 23.2R2-S2-EVO, \n  *  from 23.4-EVO before 23.4R2-EVO.",
