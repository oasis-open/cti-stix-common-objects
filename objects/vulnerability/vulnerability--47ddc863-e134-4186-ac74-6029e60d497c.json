            "description": "The Category and Taxonomy Meta Fields plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'wpaft_option_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add and delete taxonomy meta, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
