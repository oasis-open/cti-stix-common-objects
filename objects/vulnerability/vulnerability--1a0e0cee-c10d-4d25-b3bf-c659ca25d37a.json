            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Add null checks for 'stream' and 'plane' before dereferencing\n\nThis commit adds null checks for the 'stream' and 'plane' variables in\nthe dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations function. These variables were\npreviously assumed to be null at line 922, but they were used later in\nthe code without checking if they were null. This could potentially lead\nto a null pointer dereference, which would cause a crash.\n\nThe null checks ensure that 'stream' and 'plane' are not null before\nthey are used, preventing potential crashes.\n\nFixes the below static smatch checker:\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:938 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'stream' could be null (see line 922)\ndrivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn30/dcn30_hwseq.c:940 dcn30_apply_idle_power_optimizations() error: we previously assumed 'plane' could be null (see line 922)",
