The web server of affected devices does not sanitize the input parameters in specific GET requests that allow for code execution on operating system level. In combination with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-47902, CVE-2024-47903, CVE-2024-47904) this could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
