            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc\n\nCommit 15c7fab0e047 (\"ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to\nsoundcards\") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the\nQualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,\nexcept that it forgot to update SC7280 card.\n\nJust like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card\ndriver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound\nplayback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of\nuninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having\nsimilar issue).",
