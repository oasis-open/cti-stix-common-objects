            "description": "The Aiomatic - Automatic AI Content Writer & Editor, GPT-3 & GPT-4, ChatGPT ChatBot & AI Toolkit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'aiomatic_generate_featured_image' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
