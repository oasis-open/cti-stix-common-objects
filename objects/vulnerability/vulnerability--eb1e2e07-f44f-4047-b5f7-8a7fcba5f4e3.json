            "description": "During a snapshot rollback, the client incorrectly caches the timestamp metadata. If the client checks the cache when attempting to perform the next update, the update timestamp validation will fail, preventing the next update until the cache is cleared. Users should upgrade to tough version 0.20.0 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes.",
