            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf, sockmap: Check for any of tcp_bpf_prots when cloning a listener\n\nA listening socket linked to a sockmap has its sk_prot overridden. It\npoints to one of the struct proto variants in tcp_bpf_prots. The variant\ndepends on the socket's family and which sockmap programs are attached.\n\nA child socket cloned from a TCP listener initially inherits their sk_prot.\nBut before cloning is finished, we restore the child's proto to the\nlistener's original non-tcp_bpf_prots one. This happens in\ntcp_create_openreq_child -> tcp_bpf_clone.\n\nToday, in tcp_bpf_clone we detect if the child's proto should be restored\nby checking only for the TCP_BPF_BASE proto variant. This is not\ncorrect. The sk_prot of listening socket linked to a sockmap can point to\nto any variant in tcp_bpf_prots.\n\nIf the listeners sk_prot happens to be not the TCP_BPF_BASE variant, then\nthe child socket unintentionally is left if the inherited sk_prot by\ntcp_bpf_clone.\n\nThis leads to issues like infinite recursion on close [1], because the\nchild state is otherwise not set up for use with tcp_bpf_prot operations.\n\nAdjust the check in tcp_bpf_clone to detect all of tcp_bpf_prots variants.\n\nNote that it wouldn't be sufficient to check the socket state when\noverriding the sk_prot in tcp_bpf_update_proto in order to always use the\nTCP_BPF_BASE variant for listening sockets. Since commit\nb8b8315e39ff (\"bpf, sockmap: Remove unhash handler for BPF sockmap usage\")\nit is possible for a socket to transition to TCP_LISTEN state while already\nlinked to a sockmap, e.g. connect() -> insert into map ->\nconnect(AF_UNSPEC) -> listen().\n\n[1]: https://lore.kernel.org/all/00000000000073b14905ef2e7401@google.com/",
