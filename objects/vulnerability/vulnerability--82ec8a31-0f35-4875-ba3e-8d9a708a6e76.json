            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()\n\nIf track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple\ntree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation\nis not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.\n\nA reproducer can trigger this usually at the first try:\n\n  https://gitlab.com/davidhildenbrand/scratchspace/-/raw/main/reproducers/pat_fork.c\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 26 PID: 11650 at arch/x86/mm/pat/memtype.c:983 get_pat_info+0xf6/0x110\n  Modules linked in: ...\n  CPU: 26 UID: 0 PID: 11650 Comm: repro3 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc5+ #92\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014\n  RIP: 0010:get_pat_info+0xf6/0x110\n  ...\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   ...\n   untrack_pfn+0x52/0x110\n   unmap_single_vma+0xa6/0xe0\n   unmap_vmas+0x105/0x1f0\n   exit_mmap+0xf6/0x460\n   __mmput+0x4b/0x120\n   copy_process+0x1bf6/0x2aa0\n   kernel_clone+0xab/0x440\n   __do_sys_clone+0x66/0x90\n   do_syscall_64+0x95/0x180\n\nLikely this case was missed in:\n\n  d155df53f310 (\"x86/mm/pat: clear VM_PAT if copy_p4d_range failed\")\n\n... and instead of undoing the reservation we simply cleared the VM_PAT flag.\n\nKeep the documentation of these functions in include/linux/pgtable.h,\none place is more than sufficient -- we should clean that up for the other\nfunctions like track_pfn_remap/untrack_pfn separately.",
