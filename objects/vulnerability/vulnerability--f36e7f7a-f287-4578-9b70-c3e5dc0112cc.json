            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: avoid use-after-free in ext4_ext_show_leaf()\n\nIn ext4_find_extent(), path may be freed by error or be reallocated, so\nusing a previously saved *ppath may have been freed and thus may trigger\nuse-after-free, as follows:\n\next4_split_extent\n  path = *ppath;\n  ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)\n  path = ext4_find_extent(ppath)\n  ext4_split_extent_at(ppath)\n    // ext4_find_extent fails to free path\n    // but zeroout succeeds\n  ext4_ext_show_leaf(inode, path)\n    eh = path[depth].p_hdr\n    // path use-after-free !!!\n\nSimilar to ext4_split_extent_at(), we use *ppath directly as an input to\next4_ext_show_leaf(). Fix a spelling error by the way.\n\nSame problem in ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(). Since 'path' is only\nused in ext4_ext_show_leaf(), remove 'path' and use *ppath directly.\n\nThis issue is triggered only when EXT_DEBUG is defined and therefore does\nnot affect functionality.",
