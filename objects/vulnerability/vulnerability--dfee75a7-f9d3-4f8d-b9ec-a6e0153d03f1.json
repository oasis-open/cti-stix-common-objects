            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: Add NULL pointer check in i3c_master_queue_ibi()\n\nThe I3C master driver may receive an IBI from a target device that has not\nbeen probed yet. In such cases, the master calls `i3c_master_queue_ibi()`\nto queue an IBI work task, leading to \"Unable to handle kernel read from\nunreadable memory\" and resulting in a kernel panic.\n\nTypical IBI handling flow:\n1. The I3C master scans target devices and probes their respective drivers.\n2. The target device driver calls `i3c_device_request_ibi()` to enable IBI\n   and assigns `dev->ibi = ibi`.\n3. The I3C master receives an IBI from the target device and calls\n   `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to queue the target device driverâ€™s IBI\n   handler task.\n\nHowever, since target device events are asynchronous to the I3C probe\nsequence, step 3 may occur before step 2, causing `dev->ibi` to be `NULL`,\nleading to a kernel panic.\n\nAdd a NULL pointer check in `i3c_master_queue_ibi()` to prevent accessing\nan uninitialized `dev->ibi`, ensuring stability.",
