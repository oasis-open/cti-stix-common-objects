            "description": "Dell Enterprise SONiC OS, version(s) 4.1.x, 4.2.x, contain(s) an Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') vulnerability. A high privileged attacker with remote access could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to Command execution. This is a critical severity vulnerability as it allows high privilege OS commands to be executed with a less privileged role; so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.",
