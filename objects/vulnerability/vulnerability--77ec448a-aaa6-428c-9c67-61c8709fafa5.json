            "description": "The Aeropage Sync for Airtable plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'aeropage_media_downloader' function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
