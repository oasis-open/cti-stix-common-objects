            "description": "Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and streamer. A permission verification flaw in versions prior to 0.56.0 allows any authenticated regular user to bypass authorization checks and perform administrator-only transcoding configuration operations, including creating, modifying, and deleting transcoding settings. In the threat model where administrators are trusted but regular users are not, this vulnerability represents a significant security risk when transcoding is enabled. Version 0.56.0 patches the issue.",
