            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled\n\nThe ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and\nresult in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.\n\nPanic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls\nptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already\nreleased the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external\ntimestamp event occurs.\n\nTo fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the\nPTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.",
