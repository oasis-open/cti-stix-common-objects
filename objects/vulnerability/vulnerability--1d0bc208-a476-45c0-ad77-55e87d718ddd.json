            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section\n\nWhen building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into\nthe .notes section so that Xen can find the \"startup_xen\" entry point.\nThis information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations\nare not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notes\nsection means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes\nis world-readable.\n\nTo avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that\nare expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in\nthe .notes section. The values readable in .notes are then identical to\nthose found in System.map.",
