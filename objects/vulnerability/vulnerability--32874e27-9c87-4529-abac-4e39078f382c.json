            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix crash due to out of bounds access into reg2btf_ids.\n\nWhen commit e6ac2450d6de (\"bpf: Support bpf program calling kernel function\") added\nkfunc support, it defined reg2btf_ids as a cheap way to translate the verifier\nreg type to the appropriate btf_vmlinux BTF ID, however\ncommit c25b2ae13603 (\"bpf: Replace PTR_TO_XXX_OR_NULL with PTR_TO_XXX | PTR_MAYBE_NULL\")\nmoved the __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX from the last member of bpf_reg_type enum to after\nthe base register types, and defined other variants using type flag\ncomposition. However, now, the direct usage of reg->type to index into\nreg2btf_ids may no longer fall into __BPF_REG_TYPE_MAX range, and hence lead to\nout of bounds access and kernel crash on dereference of bad pointer.",
