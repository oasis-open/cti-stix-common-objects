            "description": "SAP NetWeaver Application Server ABAP does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs, leading to DOM-basedCross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker with no privileges, to craft a malicious web message that exploits WEBGUI functionality. On successful exploitation, the malicious JavaScript payload executes in the scope of victimï¿½s browser potentially compromising their data and/or manipulating browser content. This leads to a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity. There is no impact on availability",
