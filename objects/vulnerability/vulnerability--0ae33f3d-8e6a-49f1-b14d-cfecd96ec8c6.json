            "description": "A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in multiple [Vendor Name] products due to insufficient output encoding in error messages generated by the JDBC user store connection validation request. A malicious actor can inject a specially crafted payload into the request, causing the browser to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable page.\n\nThis vulnerability may allow UI manipulation, redirection to malicious websites, or data exfiltration from the browser. However, since all session-related sensitive cookies are protected with the httpOnly flag, session hijacking is not possible.",
