            "description": "The Booster for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's wcj_product_meta shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with ShopManager-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
