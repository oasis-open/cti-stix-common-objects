            "description": "Allegra loadFieldMatch Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Allegra. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, product implements a registration mechanism that can be used to create a user with a sufficient privilege level.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the loadFieldMatch method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of LOCAL SERVICE. Was ZDI-CAN-22506.",
