            "description": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol processing of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software, Cisco IOS Software, and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing IKEv2 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKEv2 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.",
