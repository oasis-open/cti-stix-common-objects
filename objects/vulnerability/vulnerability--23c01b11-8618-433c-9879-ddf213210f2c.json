            "description": "In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, the ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module \"transfer-data-plane\". The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.",
