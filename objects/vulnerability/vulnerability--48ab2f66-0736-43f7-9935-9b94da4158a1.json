            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: pxafb: Fix possible use after free in pxafb_task()\n\nIn the pxafb_probe function, it calls the pxafb_init_fbinfo function,\nafter which &fbi->task is associated with pxafb_task. Moreover,\nwithin this pxafb_init_fbinfo function, the pxafb_blank function\nwithin the &pxafb_ops struct is capable of scheduling work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call pxafb_remove to make cleanup,\nit will call unregister_framebuffer function which can call\ndo_unregister_framebuffer to free fbi->fb through\nput_fb_info(fb_info), while the work mentioned above will be used.\nThe sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                                CPU1\n\n                                   | pxafb_task\npxafb_remove                       |\nunregister_framebuffer(info)       |\ndo_unregister_framebuffer(fb_info) |\nput_fb_info(fb_info)               |\n// free fbi->fb                    | set_ctrlr_state(fbi, state)\n                                   | __pxafb_lcd_power(fbi, 0)\n                                   | fbi->lcd_power(on, &fbi->fb.var)\n                                   | //use fbi->fb\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding\nwith the cleanup in pxafb_remove.\n\nNote that only root user can remove the driver at runtime.",
