            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhamradio: defer ax25 kfree after unregister_netdev\n\nThere is a possible race condition (use-after-free) like below\n\n (USE)                       |  (FREE)\nax25_sendmsg                 |\n ax25_queue_xmit             |\n  dev_queue_xmit             |\n   __dev_queue_xmit          |\n    __dev_xmit_skb           |\n     sch_direct_xmit         | ...\n      xmit_one               |\n       netdev_start_xmit     | tty_ldisc_kill\n        __netdev_start_xmit  |  mkiss_close\n         ax_xmit             |   kfree\n          ax_encaps          |\n                             |\n\nEven though there are two synchronization primitives before the kfree:\n1. wait_for_completion(&ax->dead). This can prevent the race with\nroutines from mkiss_ioctl. However, it cannot stop the routine coming\nfrom upper layer, i.e., the ax25_sendmsg.\n\n2. netif_stop_queue(ax->dev). It seems that this line of code aims to\nhalt the transmit queue but it fails to stop the routine that already\nbeing xmit.\n\nThis patch reorder the kfree after the unregister_netdev to avoid the\npossible UAF as the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized and won't\nreturn if there is a running routine.",
