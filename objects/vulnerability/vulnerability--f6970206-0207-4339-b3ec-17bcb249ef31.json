However, this check causes the following\nout-of-bounds issues when using KASAN:\n\n[   27.804016] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in amdgpu_dm_update_freesync_caps+0xefa/0x17a0 [amdgpu]\n[   27.804788] Read of size 1 at addr ffff8881647fdb00 by task systemd-udevd/383\n\n...\n\n[   27.821207] Memory state around the buggy address:\n[   27.821215]  ffff8881647fda00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n[   27.821224]  ffff8881647fda80: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n[   27.821234] >ffff8881647fdb00: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc\n[   27.821243]                    ^\n[   27.821250]  ffff8881647fdb80: fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc fc\n[   27.821259]  ffff8881647fdc00: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n[   27.821268] ==================================================================\n\nThis is caused because the ID extraction happens outside of the range of\nthe edid lenght.
