            "description": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or ThrottlingÂ vulnerability in the PFE management daemon (evo-pfemand) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an authenticated, network-based attacker to cause an FPC crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).When specific SNMP GET operations or specific low-priviledged CLI commands are executed, a GUID resource leak will occur, eventually leading to exhaustion and resulting in FPCs to hang. Affected FPCs need to be manually restarted to recover.\n\nGUID exhaustion will trigger a syslog message like one of the following:\n\nevo-pfemand[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...\nevo-aftmand-zx[<pid>]: get_next_guid: Ran out of Guid Space ...\nThe leak can be monitored by running the following command and taking note of the values in the rightmost column labeled Guids:\n\n\n\n\n\nuser@host> show platform application-info allocations app evo-pfemand/evo-pfemand\n\n\n\nIn case one or more of these values are constantly increasing the leak is happening.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R2-EVO,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this issue is similar to, but different from CVE-2024-47505 and CVE-2024-47508.",
