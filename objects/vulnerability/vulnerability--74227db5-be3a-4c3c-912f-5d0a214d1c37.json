            "description": "Concrete CMS versions 9.0.0 to 9.3.4 and below 8.5.18 are vulnerable to Stored XSS in the \"Next&Previous Nav\" block. A rogue administrator could add a malicious payload  by executing it in the browsers of targeted users. The Concrete CMS Security Team gave this vulnerability a CVSS v4 score of 4.6 with vector  CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:A/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N  Since the \"Next&Previous Nav\" block output was not sufficiently sanitized, the malicious payload could be executed in the browsers of targeted users. Thanks, Chu Quoc Khanh for reporting.",
