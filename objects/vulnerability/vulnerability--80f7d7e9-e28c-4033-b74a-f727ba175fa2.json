            "description": "A vulnerability in the bootloader of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device, or an authenticated, local attacker with administrative credentials, to bypass NX-OS image signature verification.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insecure bootloader settings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a series of bootloader commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass NX-OS image signature verification and load unverified software.",
