            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality where the software trusts a certificate issued by an entity that isn't authorized to issue certificates. This occurs when the \"Basic Constraints\" extension in the certificate indicates that it is meant to be an \"End Entity‚Äù. This flaw could allow an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting and potentially altering communications between the user and the website.",
