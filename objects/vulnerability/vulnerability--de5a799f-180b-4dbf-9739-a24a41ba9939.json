            "description": "matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for JavaScript. A malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's getRoomUpgradeHistory function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug. This was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1.",
