During the read, bit FR_SENT will be set on the\nrequest.\n(2) calls fuse_dev_write() to send an USE_NOTIFY_RESEND notify\nThe resend notify will resend all processing requests, so the INIT\nrequest is moved from processing list to pending list again.\n(3) calls fuse_dev_read() with an invalid output address\nfuse_dev_read() will try to copy the same INIT request to the output\naddress, but it will fail due to the invalid address, so the INIT\nrequest is ended and triggers the warning in fuse_request_end().\n\nFix it by clearing FR_SENT when re-adding requests into pending list.",
