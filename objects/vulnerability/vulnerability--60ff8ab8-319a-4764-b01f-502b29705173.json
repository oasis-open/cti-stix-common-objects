Any app on the device can send an intent with specific embedded data that will cause the com.asus.dm app to programmatically download and install the app. For the app to be downloaded and installed, certain data needs to be provided: download URL, package name, version name from the app's AndroidManifest.xml file, and the MD5 hash of the app. Moreover, any app that is installed using this method can also be programmatically uninstalled using the same unprotected component named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService.",
