            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: handle inconsistent state in nilfs_btnode_create_block()\n\nSyzbot reported that a buffer state inconsistency was detected in\nnilfs_btnode_create_block(), triggering a kernel bug.\n\nIt is not appropriate to treat this inconsistency as a bug; it can occur\nif the argument block address (the buffer index of the newly created\nblock) is a virtual block number and has been reallocated due to\ncorruption of the bitmap used to manage its allocation state.\n\nSo, modify nilfs_btnode_create_block() and its callers to treat it as a\npossible filesystem error, rather than triggering a kernel bug.",
