            "description": "The Cost Calculator Builder PRO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to price manipulation in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.96. This is due to the plugin allowing the price field to be manipulated prior to processing via the 'create_cc_order' function, called from the Cost Calculator Builder plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to manipulate the price of orders submitted via the calculator. Note: this vulnerability was partially patched with the release of Cost Calculator Builder version 3.2.17.",
