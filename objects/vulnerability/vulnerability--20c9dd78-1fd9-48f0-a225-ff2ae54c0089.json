            "description": "A flaw was found in the gnome-remote-desktop used by Anaconda's remote install feature, where a crafted RDP packet could trigger a segmentation fault. This issue causes the service to crash and remain defunct, resulting in a denial of service. It occurs pre-boot and is likely due to a NULL pointer dereference. Rebooting is required to recover the system.",
