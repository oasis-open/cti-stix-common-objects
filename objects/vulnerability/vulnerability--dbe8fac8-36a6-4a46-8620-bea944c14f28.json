            "description": "A vulnerability in the custom URL parser of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to persuade a user to download arbitrary files, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host of the targeted user.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when Cisco Webex App processes a meeting invite link. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted meeting invite link and download arbitrary files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the targeted user.",
