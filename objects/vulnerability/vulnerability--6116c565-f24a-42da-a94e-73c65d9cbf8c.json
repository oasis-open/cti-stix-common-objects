The node balancing logic in\nbalance_pgdat() evaluates all zones collectively.  If one or more zones\n(e.g., ZONE_DMA32) have enough free pages to meet their watermarks, the\nentire node is deemed balanced.  This causes balance_pgdat() to exit early\nbefore incrementing the kswapd_failures, as it considers the overall\nmemory state acceptable, even though some zones (like ZONE_NORMAL) remain\nunder significant pressure.\n\n\nThe patch ensures that zone_reclaimable_pages() includes free pages\n(NR_FREE_PAGES) in its calculation when no other reclaimable pages are\navailable (e.g., file-backed or anonymous pages).  This change prevents\nzones like ZONE_DMA32, which have sufficient free pages, from being\nmistakenly deemed unreclaimable.  By doing so, the patch ensures proper\nnode balancing, avoids masking pressure on other zones like ZONE_NORMAL,\nand prevents infinite loops in throttle_direct_reclaim() caused by\nallow_direct_reclaim(pgdat) repeatedly returning false.\n\n\nThe kernel hangs due to a task stuck in throttle_direct_reclaim(), caused\nby a node being incorrectly deemed balanced despite pressure in certain\nzones, such as ZONE_NORMAL.  This issue arises from\nzone_reclaimable_pages\n---truncated---",
