            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: address a potential NULL pointer dereference in the GRED scheduler.\n\nIf kzalloc in gred_init returns a NULL pointer, the code follows the\nerror handling path, invoking gred_destroy. This, in turn, calls\ngred_offload, where memset could receive a NULL pointer as input,\npotentially leading to a kernel crash.\n\nWhen table->opt is NULL in gred_init(), gred_change_table_def()\nis not called yet, so it is not necessary to call ->ndo_setup_tc()\nin gred_offload().",
