            "description": "A vulnerability in multiple Cisco Unified Communications and Contact Center Solutions products could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to excessive permissions that have been assigned to system commands.&nbsp;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing crafted commands on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative access to the ESXi hypervisor.",
