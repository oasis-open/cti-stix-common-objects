            "description": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nWhen a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.\n\nContinuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.\n\nThis issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.\n\nThis issue affects:\n \nJuniper Networks Junos OS:\n  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S9;\n  *  21.2 versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2 versions earlier than 23.2R2.\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7;\n  *  21.3-EVO versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5;\n  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S8;\n  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4;\n  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3;\n  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R3-S2;\n  *  22.4-EVO versions earlier than 22.4R3;\n  *  23.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R2.",
