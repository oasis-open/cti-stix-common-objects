            "description": "A vulnerability in the distribution list feature of Cisco&nbsp;Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs to another user of their organization.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for requests to update distribution lists. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to modify an existing distribution list. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify a distribution list that belongs to a user other than themselves.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
