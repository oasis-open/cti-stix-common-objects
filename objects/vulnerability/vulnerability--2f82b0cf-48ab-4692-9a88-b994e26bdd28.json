            "description": "The Animation Addons for Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary plugin installation due to a missing capability check on the install_elementor_plugin_handler() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to install and activate arbitrary plugins which can be leveraged to further infect a victim when Elementor is not activated on a vulnerable site.",
