            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation\n\nThe patch \"netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy\nand kernel side add/del/test\", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.\nBut the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows\nit down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.\n\nEric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as\nrcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors\nwhich need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy\nfunctions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at\nexecuting the command received by netlink and moving the remaining\npart only into the rcu callback.",
