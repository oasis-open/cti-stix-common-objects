            "description": "An Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in UI vulnerability in the CLI of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on QFX5000 Series allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nSeveral configuration statements meant to enforce limits on MAC learning and moves can be configured but do not take effect. This can lead to control plane overload situations which will severely impact the ability of the device to processes legitimate traffic.\n\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS Evolved on QFX5000 Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  22.2-EVO versions before 22.2R3-S5-EVO,\n\n  *  22.4-EVO versions before 22.4R3-EVO,\n  *  23.2-EVO versions before 23.2R2-EVO.",
