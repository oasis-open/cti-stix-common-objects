            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach\n\nThis is the candidate patch of CVE-2023-47233 :\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47233\n\nIn brcm80211 driver,it starts with the following invoking chain\nto start init a timeout worker:\n\n->brcmf_usb_probe\n  ->brcmf_usb_probe_cb\n    ->brcmf_attach\n      ->brcmf_bus_started\n        ->brcmf_cfg80211_attach\n          ->wl_init_priv\n            ->brcmf_init_escan\n              ->INIT_WORK(&cfg->escan_timeout_work,\n\t\t  brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker);\n\nIf we disconnect the USB by hotplug, it will call\nbrcmf_usb_disconnect to make cleanup. The invoking chain is :\n\nbrcmf_usb_disconnect\n  ->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb\n    ->brcmf_detach\n      ->brcmf_cfg80211_detach\n        ->kfree(cfg);\n\nWhile the timeout woker may still be running. This will cause\na use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker.\n\nFix it by deleting the timer and canceling the worker in\nbrcmf_cfg80211_detach.\n\n[arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com: keep timer delete as is and cancel work just before free]",
