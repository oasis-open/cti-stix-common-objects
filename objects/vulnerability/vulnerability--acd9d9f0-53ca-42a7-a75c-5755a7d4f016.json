I think this bug has always\nbeen there: I can't explain why it suddenly started happening every time\nI reboot this particular board.\n\nIn commit d953e0e837e6 (\"pps: Fix a use-after free bug when\nunregistering a source.\"), George Spelvin suggested removing the\nembedded cdev. That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've\nimplemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr\nbecoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which\ndevice.\n\nBut now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(),\nwe need to be sure the pps->dev refcount can't reach zero while\nuserspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to\npps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps->dev.\n\n    pps_core: source serial1 got cdev (251:1)\n    <...>\n    pps pps1: removed\n    pps_core: unregistering pps1\n    pps_core: deallocating pps1",
