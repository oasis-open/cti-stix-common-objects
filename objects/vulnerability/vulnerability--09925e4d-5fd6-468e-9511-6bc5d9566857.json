            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm ioctl: fix misbehavior if list_versions races with module loading\n\n__list_versions will first estimate the required space using the\n\"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_needed, &needed)\" call and then will\nfill the space using the \"dm_target_iterate(list_version_get_info,\n&iter_info)\" call. Each of these calls locks the targets using the\n\"down_read(&_lock)\" and \"up_read(&_lock)\" calls, however between the first\nand second \"dm_target_iterate\" there is no lock held and the target\nmodules can be loaded at this point, so the second \"dm_target_iterate\"\ncall may need more space than what was the first \"dm_target_iterate\"\nreturned.\n\nThe code tries to handle this overflow (see the beginning of\nlist_version_get_info), however this handling is incorrect.\n\nThe code sets \"param->data_size = param->data_start + needed\" and\n\"iter_info.end = (char *)vers+len\" - \"needed\" is the size returned by the\nfirst dm_target_iterate call; \"len\" is the size of the buffer allocated by\nuserspace.\n\n\"len\" may be greater than \"needed\"; in this case, the code will write up\nto \"len\" bytes into the buffer, however param->data_size is set to\n\"needed\", so it may write data past the param->data_size value. The ioctl\ninterface copies only up to param->data_size into userspace, thus part of\nthe result will be truncated.\n\nFix this bug by setting \"iter_info.end = (char *)vers + needed;\" - this\nguarantees that the second \"dm_target_iterate\" call will write only up to\nthe \"needed\" buffer and it will exit with \"DM_BUFFER_FULL_FLAG\" if it\noverflows the \"needed\" space - in this case, userspace will allocate a\nlarger buffer and retry.\n\nNote that there is also a bug in list_version_get_needed - we need to add\n\"strlen(tt->name) + 1\" to the needed size, not \"strlen(tt->name)\".",
