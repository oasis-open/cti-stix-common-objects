            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\naccel/ivpu: Prevent recovery invocation during probe and resume\n\nRefactor IPC send and receive functions to allow correct\nhandling of operations that should not trigger a recovery process.\n\nExpose ivpu_send_receive_internal(), which is now utilized by the D0i3\nentry, DCT initialization, and HWS initialization functions.\nThese functions have been modified to return error codes gracefully,\nrather than initiating recovery.\n\nThe updated functions are invoked within ivpu_probe() and ivpu_resume(),\nensuring that any errors encountered during these stages result in a proper\nteardown or shutdown sequence. The previous approach of triggering recovery\nwithin these functions could lead to a race condition, potentially causing\nundefined behavior and kernel crashes due to null pointer dereferences.",
