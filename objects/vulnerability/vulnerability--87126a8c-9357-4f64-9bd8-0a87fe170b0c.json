            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces\n\nWhen using iTXQ, the code assumes that there is only one vif queue for\nbroadcast packets, using the BE queue. Allowing non-BE queue marking\nviolates that assumption and txq->ac == skb_queue_mapping is no longer\nguaranteed. This can cause issues with queue handling in the driver and\nalso causes issues with the recent ATF change, resulting in an AQL\nunderflow warning.",
