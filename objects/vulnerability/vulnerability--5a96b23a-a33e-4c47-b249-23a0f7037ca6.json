I noticed that the memset_after()\nhere is done on a different part of the union (status) than the original\ncast was from (rate_driver_data), which may confuse the compiler.\n\nUnfortunately, the memset_after() trick does not work on driver_rates[]\nbecause that is part of an anonymous struct, and I could not get\nstruct_group() to do this either. Using two separate memset() calls\non the two members does address the warning though.",
