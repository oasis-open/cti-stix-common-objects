            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix timer use-after-free on failed mount\n\nSyzbot has found an ODEBUG bug in ext4_fill_super\n\nThe del_timer_sync function cancels the s_err_report timer,\nwhich reminds about filesystem errors daily. We should\nguarantee the timer is no longer active before kfree(sbi).\n\nWhen filesystem mounting fails, the flow goes to failed_mount3,\nwhere an error occurs when ext4_stop_mmpd is called, causing\na read I/O failure. This triggers the ext4_handle_error function\nthat ultimately re-arms the timer,\nleaving the s_err_report timer active before kfree(sbi) is called.\n\nFix the issue by canceling the s_err_report timer after calling ext4_stop_mmpd.",
