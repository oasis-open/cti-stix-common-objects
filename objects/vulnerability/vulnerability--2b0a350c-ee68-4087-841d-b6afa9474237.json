A code injection vulnerability was found in the live search functionality of the Ruby on Rails based Elektra web application. An authenticated user can craft a search term containing Ruby code, which later flows into an `eval` sink which executes the code. Fixed in commit 8bce00be93b95a6512ff68fe86bf9554e486bc02.",
