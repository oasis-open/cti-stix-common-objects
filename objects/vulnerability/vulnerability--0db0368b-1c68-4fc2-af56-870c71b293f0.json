            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nACPI: PPTT: Fix to avoid sleep in the atomic context when PPTT is absent\n\nCommit 0c80f9e165f8 (\"ACPI: PPTT: Leave the table mapped for the runtime usage\")\nenabled to map PPTT once on the first invocation of acpi_get_pptt() and\nnever unmapped the same allowing it to be used at runtime with out the\nhassle of mapping and unmapping the table. This was needed to fetch LLC\ninformation from the PPTT in the cpuhotplug path which is executed in\nthe atomic context as the acpi_get_table() might sleep waiting for a\nmutex.\n\nHowever it missed to handle the case when there is no PPTT on the system\nwhich results in acpi_get_pptt() being called from all the secondary\nCPUs attempting to fetch the LLC information in the atomic context\nwithout knowing the absence of PPTT resulting in the splat like below:\n\n | BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/semaphore.c:164\n | in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 1, non_block: 0, pid: 0, name: swapper/1\n | preempt_count: 1, expected: 0\n | RCU nest depth: 0, expected: 0\n | no locks held by swapper/1/0.\n | irq event stamp: 0\n | hardirqs last  enabled at (0): 0x0\n | hardirqs last disabled at (0): copy_process+0x61c/0x1b40\n | softirqs last  enabled at (0): copy_process+0x61c/0x1b40\n | softirqs last disabled at (0): 0x0\n | CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 6.3.0-rc1 #1\n | Call trace:\n |  dump_backtrace+0xac/0x138\n |  show_stack+0x30/0x48\n |  dump_stack_lvl+0x60/0xb0\n |  dump_stack+0x18/0x28\n |  __might_resched+0x160/0x270\n |  __might_sleep+0x58/0xb0\n |  down_timeout+0x34/0x98\n |  acpi_os_wait_semaphore+0x7c/0xc0\n |  acpi_ut_acquire_mutex+0x58/0x108\n |  acpi_get_table+0x40/0xe8\n |  acpi_get_pptt+0x48/0xa0\n |  acpi_get_cache_info+0x38/0x140\n |  init_cache_level+0xf4/0x118\n |  detect_cache_attributes+0x2e4/0x640\n |  update_siblings_masks+0x3c/0x330\n |  store_cpu_topology+0x88/0xf0\n |  secondary_start_kernel+0xd0/0x168\n |  __secondary_switched+0xb8/0xc0\n\nUpdate acpi_get_pptt() to consider the fact that PPTT is once checked and\nis not available on the system and return NULL avoiding any attempts to\nfetch PPTT and thereby avoiding any possible sleep waiting for a mutex\nin the atomic context.",
