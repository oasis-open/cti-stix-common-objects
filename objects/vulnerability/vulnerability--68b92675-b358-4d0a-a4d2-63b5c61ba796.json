            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition\n\nIn the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with\nsvc_i3c_master_hj_work, &master->ibi_work is bound with\nsvc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start the\nhj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.\n\nIf we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove to\nmake cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister\nwhile the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations\nthat may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:\n\nCPU0                                         CPU1\n\n                                    | svc_i3c_master_hj_work\nsvc_i3c_master_remove               |\ni3c_master_unregister(&master->base)|\ndevice_unregister(&master->dev)     |\ndevice_release                      |\n//free master->base                 |\n                                    | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)\n                                    | //use master->base\n\nFix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the\ncleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.",
