            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nthermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal\n\nSince thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can\nrun in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free\nthe struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been\nchecked against NULL.\n\nIf that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory\nthat has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.\n\nAddress this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around\nthe cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the\nsame time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.\n\nCc :6.8+ <stable@vger.kernel.org> # 6.8+",
