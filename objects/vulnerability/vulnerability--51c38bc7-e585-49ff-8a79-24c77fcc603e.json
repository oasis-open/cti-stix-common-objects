            "description": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Captive Portal Content Delivery (CPCD) services daemon (cpcd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MS-PIC, MS-SPC3, MS-MIC or MS-MPC allows an attacker to send malformed HTTP packets to the device thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS), crashing the Multiservices PIC Management Daemon (mspmand) process thereby denying users the ability to login, while concurrently impacting other mspmand services and traffic through the device. Continued receipt and processing of these malformed packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. While the Services PIC is restarting, all PIC services will be bypassed until the Services PIC completes its boot process. An attacker sending these malformed HTTP packets to the device who is not part of the Captive Portal experience is not able to exploit this issue. This issue is not applicable to MX RE-based CPCD platforms. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series 17.3 version 17.3R1 and later versions prior to 17.4 versions 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S9; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S1; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3. This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R1.",
