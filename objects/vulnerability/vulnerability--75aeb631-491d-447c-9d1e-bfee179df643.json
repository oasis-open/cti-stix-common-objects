            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: xilinx_uartps: split sysrq handling\n\nlockdep detects the following circular locking dependency:\n\nCPU 0                      CPU 1\n========================== ============================\ncdns_uart_isr()            printk()\n  uart_port_lock(port)       console_lock()\n\t\t\t     cdns_uart_console_write()\n                               if (!port->sysrq)\n                                 uart_port_lock(port)\n  uart_handle_break()\n    port->sysrq = ...\n  uart_handle_sysrq_char()\n    printk()\n      console_lock()\n\nThe fixed commit attempts to avoid this situation by only taking the\nport lock in cdns_uart_console_write if port->sysrq unset. However, if\n(as shown above) cdns_uart_console_write runs before port->sysrq is set,\nthen it will try to take the port lock anyway. This may result in a\ndeadlock.\n\nFix this by splitting sysrq handling into two parts. We use the prepare\nhelper under the port lock and defer handling until we release the lock.",
