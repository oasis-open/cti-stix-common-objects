If the JIRA macro is installed, any logged in XWiki user could edit his/her user profile wiki page and use that JIRA macro, specifying a fake JIRA URL that returns an XML specifying a DOCTYPE pointing to a local file on the XWiki server host and displaying that file's content in one of the returned JIRA fields (such as the summary or description for example).
