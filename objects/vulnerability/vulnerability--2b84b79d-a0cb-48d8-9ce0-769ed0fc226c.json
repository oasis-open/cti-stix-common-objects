            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check\n\nHot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race\ncondition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires\npci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child\nhotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire\npci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.\n\nThe deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()\nfirst, not if the child happens to acquire it first.\n\nSeveral workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded\nover the years, e.g.:\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/\n\nA proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial\nand necessarily intrusive.\n\nRecent commit 9d573d19547b (\"PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during\nsystem sleep\") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when\nremoving more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit\nsought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.\nDifferentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible\nbecause pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as\nif it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.\n\nAvoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the\nhotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking\nwhether its child device was replaced.\n\nThis works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down\norder for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device\nreplacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using\npci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably\ndetect being removed.",
