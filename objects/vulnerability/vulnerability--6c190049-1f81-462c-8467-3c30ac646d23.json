When\ncommit new state which directly referring to info stored in dc_sink will cause null pointer\ndereference.\n\n[how]\nRemove redundant checking condition. Relevant condition should already be covered by checking\nif dsc_aux is null or not. Also reset dsc_aux to NULL when the connector is disconnected.",
