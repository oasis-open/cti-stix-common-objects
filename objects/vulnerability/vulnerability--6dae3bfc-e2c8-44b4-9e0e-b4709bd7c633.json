The ce_util_to_unsigned_bin function, instead of operating on the size of the unsigned character buffer that is passed, operates on the address - i.e. operates on \"c\" instead of \"*c\". Decrementing the address to check if it is less than zero means that the operation will always pass, since a pointer will never be less than zero, and may result in a buffer overflow.",
