            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu/vt-d: Fix PCI device refcount leak in dmar_dev_scope_init()\n\nfor_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of\npci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the\nreturned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input\npci_dev @from if it is not NULL.\n\nIf we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call\npci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missing\npci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count leak.",
