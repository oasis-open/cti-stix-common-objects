The BMP_Loader.dll library in affected applications lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files. This could result in an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-13057)",
