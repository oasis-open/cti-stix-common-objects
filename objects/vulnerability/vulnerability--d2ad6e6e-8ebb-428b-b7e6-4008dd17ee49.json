            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow\n\nWhen testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in\n'mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow' because subflow_req->msk is NULL.\n\nCall trace:\n\n  mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:63 (discriminator 4)) (P)\n  subflow_syn_recv_sock (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:854)\n  tcp_check_req (./net/ipv4/tcp_minisocks.c:863)\n  tcp_v4_rcv (./net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:2268)\n  ip_protocol_deliver_rcu (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:207)\n  ip_local_deliver_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:234)\n  ip_local_deliver (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:254)\n  ip_rcv_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:449)\n  ...\n\nAccording to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very\nshort time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due\nto multiple reasons.\n\nEven if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they\ncan be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The\n'subflow_req->msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,\nand there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.\n\nThis patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req->msk' under the\n`own_req == true` conditional.\n\nNote that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because\nthe same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the\ncode has been moved to.",
