            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco DNA Spaces Connector could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient restrictions during the execution of affected CLI commands. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by leveraging the insufficient restrictions during execution of these commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges from dnasadmin and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as root.",
