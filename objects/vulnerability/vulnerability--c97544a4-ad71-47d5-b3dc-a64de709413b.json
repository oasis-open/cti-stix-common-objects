            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the msprox endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19846.",
