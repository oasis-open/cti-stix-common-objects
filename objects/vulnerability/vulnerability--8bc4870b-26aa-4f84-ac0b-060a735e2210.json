            "description": "In mlflow/mlflow version 2.17.2, the `/graphql` endpoint is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. An attacker can create large batches of queries that repeatedly request all runs from a given experiment. This can tie up all the workers allocated by MLFlow, rendering the application unable to respond to other requests. This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled resource consumption.",
