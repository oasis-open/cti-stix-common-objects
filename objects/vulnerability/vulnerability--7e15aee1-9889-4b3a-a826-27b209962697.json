            "description": "Sandboxie is a sandbox-based isolation software for 32-bit and 64-bit Windows NT-based operating systems. An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users' files in `C:\\Sandbox\\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\\Users\\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**.\nAll files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\\Sandox\\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\\Sandbox\\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed. Users are advised to limit access to their systems using Sandboxie.",
