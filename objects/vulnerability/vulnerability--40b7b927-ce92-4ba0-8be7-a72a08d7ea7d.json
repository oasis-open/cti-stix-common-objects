            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/radeon: fix uninitialized size issue in radeon_vce_cs_parse()\n\nOn the off chance that command stream passed from userspace via\nioctl() call to radeon_vce_cs_parse() is weirdly crafted and\nfirst command to execute is to encode (case 0x03000001), the function\nin question will attempt to call radeon_vce_cs_reloc() with size\nargument that has not been properly initialized. Specifically, 'size'\nwill point to 'tmp' variable before the latter had a chance to be\nassigned any value.\n\nPlay it safe and init 'tmp' with 0, thus ensuring that\nradeon_vce_cs_reloc() will catch an early error in cases like these.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static\nanalysis tool SVACE.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 2d52de55f9ee7aaee0e09ac443f77855989c6b68)",
