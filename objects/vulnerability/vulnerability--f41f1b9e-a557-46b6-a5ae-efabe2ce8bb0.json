            "description": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software running on Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces when an administrator enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.",
