            "description": "The Real Estate 7 WordPress theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation via the 'template-submit-listing.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Seller-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible if front-end listing submission has been enabled.",
