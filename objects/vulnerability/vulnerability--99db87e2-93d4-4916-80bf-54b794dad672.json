            "description": "Substance3D - Modeler versions 1.21.0 and earlier are affected by an Uncontrolled Search Path Element vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. If the application relies on a search path to locate critical resources such as libraries or executables, an attacker could manipulate the search path to load a malicious resource, potentially executing arbitrary code. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.",
