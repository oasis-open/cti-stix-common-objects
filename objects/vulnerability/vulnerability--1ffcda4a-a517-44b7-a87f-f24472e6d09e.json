            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxhci: Fix Panther point NULL pointer deref at full-speed re-enumeration\n\nre-enumerating full-speed devices after a failed address device command\ncan trigger a NULL pointer dereference.\n\nFull-speed devices may need to reconfigure the endpoint 0 Max Packet Size\nvalue during enumeration. Usb core calls usb_ep0_reinit() in this case,\nwhich ends up calling xhci_configure_endpoint().\n\nOn Panther point xHC the xhci_configure_endpoint() function will\nadditionally check and reserve bandwidth in software. Other hosts do\nthis in hardware\n\nIf xHC address device command fails then a new xhci_virt_device structure\nis allocated as part of re-enabling the slot, but the bandwidth table\npointers are not set up properly here.\nThis triggers the NULL pointer dereference the next time usb_ep0_reinit()\nis called and xhci_configure_endpoint() tries to check and reserve\nbandwidth\n\n[46710.713538] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 5 using xhci_hcd\n[46710.713699] usb 3-1: Device not responding to setup address.\n[46710.917684] usb 3-1: Device not responding to setup address.\n[46711.125536] usb 3-1: device not accepting address 5, error -71\n[46711.125594] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008\n[46711.125600] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n[46711.125603] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n[46711.125606] PGD 0 P4D 0\n[46711.125610] Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI\n[46711.125615] CPU: 1 PID: 25760 Comm: kworker/1:2 Not tainted 6.10.3_2 #1\n[46711.125620] Hardware name: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.\n[46711.125623] Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event [usbcore]\n[46711.125668] RIP: 0010:xhci_reserve_bandwidth (drivers/usb/host/xhci.c\n\nFix this by making sure bandwidth table pointers are set up correctly\nafter a failed address device command, and additionally by avoiding\nchecking for bandwidth in cases like this where no actual endpoints are\nadded or removed, i.e. only context for default control endpoint 0 is\nevaluated.",
