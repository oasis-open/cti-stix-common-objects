            "description": "your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking dashboard. YourSpotify versions < 1.8.0 use a hardcoded JSON Web Token (JWT) secret to sign authentication tokens. Attackers can use this well-known value to forge valid authentication tokens for arbitrary users. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass authentication and authenticate as arbitrary YourSpotify users, including admin users. This issue has been addressed in version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
