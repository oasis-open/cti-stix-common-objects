            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: nexthop: Initialize all fields in dumped nexthops\n\nstruct nexthop_grp contains two reserved fields that are not initialized by\nnla_put_nh_group(), and carry garbage. This can be observed e.g. with\nstrace (edited for clarity):\n\n    # ip nexthop add id 1 dev lo\n    # ip nexthop add id 101 group 1\n    # strace -e recvmsg ip nexthop get id 101\n    ...\n    recvmsg(... [{nla_len=12, nla_type=NHA_GROUP},\n                 [{id=1, weight=0, resvd1=0x69, resvd2=0x67}]] ...) = 52\n\nThe fields are reserved and therefore not currently used. But as they are, they\nleak kernel memory, and the fact they are not just zero complicates repurposing\nof the fields for new ends. Initialize the full structure.",
