            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()\n\nThere was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and\nteardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was\nrunning in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad\npossibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by\nfree_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.\n\nThis is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a\ntest case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is\npossible (see link below).\n\nFix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall\nswapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that\nthe swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()\nbecause it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting\nthe reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in\nfree_swap_and_cache().\n\nDetails of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand\nfor deriving this):\n\n--8<-----\n\n__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in\n\"count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\".\n\nswapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.\n\nSo the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn\nsi->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().\n\nImagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are\nstill references by swap entries.\n\nProcess 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.\nProcess 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.\n\nProcess 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().\n-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\n[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]\n\nProcess 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().\n-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE\n\nProcess 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls\n__try_to_reclaim_swap().\n\n__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->\nput_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->\nswap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->\n...\nWRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);\n\nWhat stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache\nbut before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?\n\n--8<-----",
