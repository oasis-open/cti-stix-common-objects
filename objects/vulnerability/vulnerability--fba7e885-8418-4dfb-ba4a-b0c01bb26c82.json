            "description": "An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the active-lease query portion in JDHCPD's DHCP Relay Agent of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending a crafted DHCP packet to the device thereby crashing the jdhcpd DHCP service. This is typically configured for Broadband Subscriber Sessions. Continued receipt and processing of this crafted packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S1, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R2. This issue does not affect Junos OS Evolved.",
