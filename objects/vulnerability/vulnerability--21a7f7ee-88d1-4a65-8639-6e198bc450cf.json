            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: sh: aica: reorder cleanup operations to avoid UAF bugs\n\nThe dreamcastcard->timer could schedule the spu_dma_work and the\nspu_dma_work could also arm the dreamcastcard->timer.\n\nWhen the snd_pcm_substream is closing, the aica_channel will be\ndeallocated. But it could still be dereferenced in the worker\nthread. The reason is that del_timer() will return directly\nregardless of whether the timer handler is running or not and\nthe worker could be rescheduled in the timer handler. As a result,\nthe UAF bug will happen. The racy situation is shown below:\n\n      (Thread 1)                 |      (Thread 2)\nsnd_aicapcm_pcm_close()          |\n ...                             |  run_spu_dma() //worker\n                                 |    mod_timer()\n  flush_work()                   |\n  del_timer()                    |  aica_period_elapsed() //timer\n  kfree(dreamcastcard->channel)  |    schedule_work()\n                                 |  run_spu_dma() //worker\n  ...                            |    dreamcastcard->channel-> //USE\n\nIn order to mitigate this bug and other possible corner cases,\ncall mod_timer() conditionally in run_spu_dma(), then implement\nPCM sync_stop op to cancel both the timer and worker. The sync_stop\nop will be called from PCM core appropriately when needed.",
