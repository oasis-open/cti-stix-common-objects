            "description": "The Education Addon for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.1 via the naedu_elementor_template shortcode due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract information from posts that are not public, including drafts, password protected, and restricted posts. This applies to posts created with Elementor only.",
