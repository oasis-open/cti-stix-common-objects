            "description": "Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the Forensic Recorder service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to overwrite arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-21677.",
