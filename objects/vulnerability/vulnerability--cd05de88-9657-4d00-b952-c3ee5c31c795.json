However, due to\nmsg_id reuse resulting in a successful copen, the anonymous fd is not\nclosed until the daemon exits. Therefore read requests waiting for reopen\nto complete may trigger hung task.\n\nTo avoid this issue, allocate the msg_id cyclically to avoid reusing the\nmsg_id for a very short duration of time.",
