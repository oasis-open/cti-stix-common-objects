            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nscsi: pm80xx: Set phy->enable_completion only when we wait for it\n\npm8001_phy_control() populates the enable_completion pointer with a stack\naddress, sends a PHY_LINK_RESET / PHY_HARD_RESET, waits 300 ms, and\nreturns. The problem arises when a phy control response comes late.  After\n300 ms the pm8001_phy_control() function returns and the passed\nenable_completion stack address is no longer valid. Late phy control\nresponse invokes complete() on a dangling enable_completion pointer which\nleads to a kernel crash.",
