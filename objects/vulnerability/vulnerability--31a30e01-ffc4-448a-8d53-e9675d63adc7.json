            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mscc: ocelot: fix incorrect IFH SRC_PORT field in ocelot_ifh_set_basic()\n\nPackets injected by the CPU should have a SRC_PORT field equal to the\nCPU port module index in the Analyzer block (ocelot->num_phys_ports).\n\nThe blamed commit copied the ocelot_ifh_set_basic() call incorrectly\nfrom ocelot_xmit_common() in net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c. Instead of calling\nwith \"x\", it calls with BIT_ULL(x), but the field is not a port mask,\nbut rather a single port index.\n\n[ side note: this is the technical debt of code duplication :( ]\n\nThe error used to be silent and doesn't appear to have other\nuser-visible manifestations, but with new changes in the packing\nlibrary, it now fails loudly as follows:\n\n------------[ cut here ]------------\nCannot store 0x40 inside bits 46-43 - will truncate\nsja1105 spi2.0: xmit timed out\nWARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 102 at lib/packing.c:98 __pack+0x90/0x198\nsja1105 spi2.0: timed out polling for tstamp\nCPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 102 Comm: felix_xmit\nTainted: G        W        N 6.13.0-rc1-00372-gf706b85d972d-dirty #2605\nCall trace:\n __pack+0x90/0x198 (P)\n __pack+0x90/0x198 (L)\n packing+0x78/0x98\n ocelot_ifh_set_basic+0x260/0x368\n ocelot_port_inject_frame+0xa8/0x250\n felix_port_deferred_xmit+0x14c/0x258\n kthread_worker_fn+0x134/0x350\n kthread+0x114/0x138\n\nThe code path pertains to the ocelot switchdev driver and to the felix\nsecondary DSA tag protocol, ocelot-8021q.
