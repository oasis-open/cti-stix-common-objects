            "description": "An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the chassis management daemon (chassisd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a \n\nDenial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nIf an attempt is made to access specific sensors on platforms not supporting these sensors, either via GRPC or netconf, chassisd will crash and restart leading to a restart of all FPCs and thereby a complete outage.\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS:\n\n\n\n  *  21.4 versions from 21.4R3 before 21.4R3-S5,\n  *  22.1 versions from 22.1R3 before 22.1R3-S4,\n  *  22.2 versions from 22.2R2 before 22.2R3,\n  *  22.3 versions from 22.3R1 before 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3,\n  *  22.4 versions from 22.4R1 before 22.4R2.\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Junos OS versions earlier than 21.4.",
