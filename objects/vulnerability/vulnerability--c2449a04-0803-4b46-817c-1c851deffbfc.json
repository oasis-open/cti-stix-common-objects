            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblk-cgroup: Fix UAF in blkcg_unpin_online()\n\nblkcg_unpin_online() walks up the blkcg hierarchy putting the online pin. To\nwalk up, it uses blkcg_parent(blkcg) but it was calling that after\nblkcg_destroy_blkgs(blkcg) which could free the blkcg, leading to the\nfollowing UAF:\n\n  ==================================================================\n  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in blkcg_unpin_online+0x15a/0x270\n  Read of size 8 at addr ffff8881057678c0 by task kworker/9:1/117\n\n  CPU: 9 UID: 0 PID: 117 Comm: kworker/9:1 Not tainted 6.13.0-rc1-work-00182-gb8f52214c61a-dirty #48\n  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS unknown 02/02/2022\n  Workqueue: cgwb_release cgwb_release_workfn\n  Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n   dump_stack_lvl+0x27/0x80\n   print_report+0x151/0x710\n   kasan_report+0xc0/0x100\n   blkcg_unpin_online+0x15a/0x270\n   cgwb_release_workfn+0x194/0x480\n   process_scheduled_works+0x71b/0xe20\n   worker_thread+0x82a/0xbd0\n   kthread+0x242/0x2c0\n   ret_from_fork+0x33/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n   </TASK>\n  ...\n  Freed by task 1944:\n   kasan_save_track+0x2b/0x70\n   kasan_save_free_info+0x3c/0x50\n   __kasan_slab_free+0x33/0x50\n   kfree+0x10c/0x330\n   css_free_rwork_fn+0xe6/0xb30\n   process_scheduled_works+0x71b/0xe20\n   worker_thread+0x82a/0xbd0\n   kthread+0x242/0x2c0\n   ret_from_fork+0x33/0x70\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n\nNote that the UAF is not easy to trigger as the free path is indirected\nbehind a couple RCU grace periods and a work item execution.
