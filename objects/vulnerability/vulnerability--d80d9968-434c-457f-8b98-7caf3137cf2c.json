In versions of the FHIR2 module prior to 2.5.0, privileges were not always correctly checked, which means that unauthorized users may have been able to add or edit data they were not supposed to be able to. All implementers should update to FHIR2 2.5.0 or newer as soon as is feasible to receive a patch.",
