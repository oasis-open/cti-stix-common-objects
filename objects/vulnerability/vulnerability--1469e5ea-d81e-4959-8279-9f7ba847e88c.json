A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to induce the application to perform server-side DNS lookups or HTTP requests to arbitrary domain names. By submitting suitable payloads, an attacker can cause the application server to attack other systems that it can interact with.  IBM X-Force ID:  220903.",
