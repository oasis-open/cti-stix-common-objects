            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nremoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULL\n\nIn imx_rproc_addr_init() \"nph = of_count_phandle_with_args()\" just counts\nnumber of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() in\nthe parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced.\nAdjust this issue by adding NULL-return check.\n\nFound by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.\n\n[Fixed title to fit within the prescribed 70-75 charcters]",
