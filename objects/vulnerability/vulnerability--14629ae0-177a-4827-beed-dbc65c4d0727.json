            "description": "An Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized ActorÂ vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series devices allows a local, low-privileged user with access to the Junos CLI to view the contents of sensitive files on the file system.\n\nThrough the execution of either 'show services advanced-anti-malware' or 'show services security-intelligence' command, a user with limited permissions (e.g., a low privilege login class user) can access protected files that should not be accessible to the user. These files may contain sensitive information that can be used to cause further impact to the system.\n\n\nThis issue affects Junos OS SRX Series:\n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S8,\n\n  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,\n\n  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,\n  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,\n\n  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2-S1,\n\n  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R2.",
