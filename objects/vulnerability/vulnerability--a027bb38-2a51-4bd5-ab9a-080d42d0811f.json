            "description": "A vulnerability in the Image Signature Verification feature of Cisco&nbsp;SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level credentials to install a malicious software patch on an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper verification of digital signatures for patch images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an unsigned software patch to bypass signature checks and loading it on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious software patch image.Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.",
