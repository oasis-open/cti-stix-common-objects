            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nhrtimers: Force migrate away hrtimers queued after CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING\n\nhrtimers are migrated away from the dying CPU to any online target at\nthe CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING stage in order not to delay bandwidth timers\nhandling tasks involved in the CPU hotplug forward progress.\n\nHowever wakeups can still be performed by the outgoing CPU after\nCPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING. Those can result again in bandwidth timers being\narmed. Depending on several considerations (crystal ball power management\nbased election, earliest timer already enqueued, timer migration enabled or\nnot), the target may eventually be the current CPU even if offline. If that\nhappens, the timer is eventually ignored.\n\nThe most notable example is RCU which had to deal with each and every of\nthose wake-ups by deferring them to an online CPU, along with related\nworkarounds:\n\n_ e787644caf76 (rcu: Defer RCU kthreads wakeup when CPU is dying)\n_ 9139f93209d1 (rcu/nocb: Fix RT throttling hrtimer armed from offline CPU)\n_ f7345ccc62a4 (rcu/nocb: Fix rcuog wake-up from offline softirq)\n\nThe problem isn't confined to RCU though as the stop machine kthread\n(which runs CPUHP_AP_HRTIMERS_DYING) reports its completion at the end\nof its work through cpu_stop_signal_done() and performs a wake up that\neventually arms the deadline server timer:\n\n   WARNING: CPU: 94 PID: 588 at kernel/time/hrtimer.c:1086 hrtimer_start_range_ns+0x289/0x2d0\n   CPU: 94 UID: 0 PID: 588 Comm: migration/94 Not tainted\n   Stopper: multi_cpu_stop+0x0/0x120 <- stop_machine_cpuslocked+0x66/0xc0\n   RIP: 0010:hrtimer_start_range_ns+0x289/0x2d0\n   Call Trace:\n   <TASK>\n     start_dl_timer\n     enqueue_dl_entity\n     dl_server_start\n     enqueue_task_fair\n     enqueue_task\n     ttwu_do_activate\n     try_to_wake_up\n     complete\n     cpu_stopper_thread\n\nInstead of providing yet another bandaid to work around the situation, fix\nit in the hrtimers infrastructure instead: always migrate away a timer to\nan online target whenever it is enqueued from an offline CPU.\n\nThis will also allow to revert all the above RCU disgraceful hacks.",
