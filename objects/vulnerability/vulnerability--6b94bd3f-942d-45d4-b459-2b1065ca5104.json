            "description": "The WordPress Video Robot - The Ultimate Video Importer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insufficient validation on user meta that can be updated in the wpvr_rate_request_result() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.20.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to update their user meta on a WordPress site. This can be leveraged to update their capabilities to that of an administrator.",
