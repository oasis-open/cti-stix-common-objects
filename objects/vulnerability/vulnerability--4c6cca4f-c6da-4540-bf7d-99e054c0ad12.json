            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: initialize integrity buffer to zero before writing it to media\n\nMetadata added by bio_integrity_prep is using plain kmalloc, which leads\nto random kernel memory being written media.  For PI metadata this is\nlimited to the app tag that isn't used by kernel generated metadata,\nbut for non-PI metadata the entire buffer leaks kernel memory.\n\nFix this by adding the __GFP_ZERO flag to allocations for writes.",
