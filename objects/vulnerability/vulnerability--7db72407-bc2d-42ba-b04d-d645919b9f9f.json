            "description": "A Use-After-Free vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald)\n\n of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause l2ald to crash leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS).\n\nIn an EVPN-VXLAN scenario, when \n\nstate updates are received and processed by the affected system, the correct order of some processing steps is not ensured, which can lead to an l2ald crash and restart. Whether the crash occurs depends on system internal timing which is outside the attackers control.\nThis issue affects:\n\nJunos OS: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S8,\n  *  21.2 versions before 21.2R3-S6,\n  *  21.3 versions before 21.3R3-S5,\n  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S4,\n  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S3,\n  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S1,\n  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3,,\n  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R2;\n\n\n\n\nJunos OS Evolved: \n\n\n\n  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S8-EVO,\n  *  21.2-EVO versions before 21.2R3-S6-EVO, \n  *  21.3-EVO\n\n versions before 21.3R3-S5-EVO,\n  *  21.4-EVO\n\n versions before 21.4R3-S4-EVO,\n  *  22.1-EVO\n\n versions before 22.1R3-S3-EVO,\n  *  22.2-EVO\n\n versions before 22.2R3-S1-EVO,\n  *  22.3-EVO\n\n versions before 22.3R3-EVO,\n  *  22.4-EVO\n\n versions before 22.4R2-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n",
