            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in SiPass integrated AC5102 (ACC-G2) (All versions), SiPass integrated ACC-AP (All versions). Affected devices do not properly check the integrity of firmware updates. This could allow a local attacker to upload a maliciously modified firmware onto the device. In a second scenario, a remote attacker who is able to intercept the transfer of a valid firmware from the server to the device could modify the firmware \"on the fly\".",
