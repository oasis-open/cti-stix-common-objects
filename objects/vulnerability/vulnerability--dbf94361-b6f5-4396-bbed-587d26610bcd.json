            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/amd_nb: Use rdmsr_safe() in amd_get_mmconfig_range()\n\nXen doesn't offer MSR_FAM10H_MMIO_CONF_BASE to all guests.  This results\nin the following warning:\n\n  unchecked MSR access error: RDMSR from 0xc0010058 at rIP: 0xffffffff8101d19f (xen_do_read_msr+0x7f/0xa0)\n  Call Trace:\n   xen_read_msr+0x1e/0x30\n   amd_get_mmconfig_range+0x2b/0x80\n   quirk_amd_mmconfig_area+0x28/0x100\n   pnp_fixup_device+0x39/0x50\n   __pnp_add_device+0xf/0x150\n   pnp_add_device+0x3d/0x100\n   pnpacpi_add_device_handler+0x1f9/0x280\n   acpi_ns_get_device_callback+0x104/0x1c0\n   acpi_ns_walk_namespace+0x1d0/0x260\n   acpi_get_devices+0x8a/0xb0\n   pnpacpi_init+0x50/0x80\n   do_one_initcall+0x46/0x2e0\n   kernel_init_freeable+0x1da/0x2f0\n   kernel_init+0x16/0x1b0\n   ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n   ret_from_fork_asm+0x1b/0x30\n\nbased on quirks for a \"PNP0c01\" device.
