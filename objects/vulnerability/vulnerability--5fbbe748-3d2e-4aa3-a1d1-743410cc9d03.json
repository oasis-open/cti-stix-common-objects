            "description": "TopQuadrant TopBraid EDG stores external credentials insecurely. An authenticated attacker with file system access can read edg-setup.properites and obtain the secret to decrypt external passwords stored in edg-vault.properties. An authenticated attacker could gain file system access using a separate vulnerability such as CVE-2024-45745.Â At least version 7.1.3 is affected. Version 7.3 adds HashiCorp Vault integration that does not store external passwords locally.",
