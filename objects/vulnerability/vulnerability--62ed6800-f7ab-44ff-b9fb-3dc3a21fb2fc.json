            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit\n\nThis issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl\nFBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct\ncontaining only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel\nwith values.\n\nIf this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the\nvc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),\nleaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to\nthe updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to\nfbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a\nwrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes\nthe imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.\n\nTo solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called\neven if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will\n\"fix and fill\" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.",
