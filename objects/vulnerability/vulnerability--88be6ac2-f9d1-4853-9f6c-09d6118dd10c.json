            "description": "A vulnerability in a specific REST API endpoint of Cisco NDFC could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, remote attacker to learn sensitive information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls on the affected REST API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the&nbsp;affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download config only or full backup files and learn sensitive configuration information. This vulnerability only affects a specific REST API endpoint and does not affect the web-based management interface.",
