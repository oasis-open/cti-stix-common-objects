            "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the MPEG-TS parser. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19773.",
