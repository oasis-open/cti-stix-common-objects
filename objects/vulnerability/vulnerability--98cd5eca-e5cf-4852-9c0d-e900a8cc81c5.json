Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.\n- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last\n  element is out of bounds.\n\nThe out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being\naccessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes\nin active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds\nelement is part of an unmapped page.",
