            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRDMA/hfi1: Prevent use of lock before it is initialized\n\nIf there is a failure during probe of hfi1 before the sdma_map_lock is\ninitialized, the call to hfi1_free_devdata() will attempt to use a lock\nthat has not been initialized. If the locking correctness validator is on\nthen an INFO message and stack trace resembling the following may be seen:\n\n  INFO: trying to register non-static key.\n  The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe\n  you didn't initialize this object before use?\n  turning off the locking correctness validator.\n  Call Trace:\n  register_lock_class+0x11b/0x880\n  __lock_acquire+0xf3/0x7930\n  lock_acquire+0xff/0x2d0\n  _raw_spin_lock_irq+0x46/0x60\n  sdma_clean+0x42a/0x660 [hfi1]\n  hfi1_free_devdata+0x3a7/0x420 [hfi1]\n  init_one+0x867/0x11a0 [hfi1]\n  pci_device_probe+0x40e/0x8d0\n\nThe use of sdma_map_lock in sdma_clean() is for freeing the sdma_map\nmemory, and sdma_map is not allocated/initialized until after\nsdma_map_lock has been initialized. This code only needs to be run if\nsdma_map is not NULL, and so checking for that condition will avoid trying\nto use the lock before it is initialized.",
