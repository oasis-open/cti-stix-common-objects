            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active references\n\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers(), which iterates through the buffers\nattached to dirty data folios/pages, accesses the attached buffers without\nlocking the folios/pages.\n\nFor data cache, nilfs_clear_folio_dirty() may be called asynchronously\nwhen the file system degenerates to read only, so\nnilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() still has the potential to cause use\nafter free issues when buffers lose the protection of their dirty state\nmidway due to this asynchronous clearing and are unintentionally freed by\ntry_to_free_buffers().\n\nEliminate this race issue by adjusting the lock section in this function.",
