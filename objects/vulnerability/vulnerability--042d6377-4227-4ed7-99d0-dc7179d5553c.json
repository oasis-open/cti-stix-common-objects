            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: leds: fix memory leak\n\nA network restart test on a router led to an out-of-memory condition,\nwhich was traced to a memory leak in the PHY LED trigger code.\n\nThe root cause is misuse of the devm API. The registration function\n(phy_led_triggers_register) is called from phy_attach_direct, not\nphy_probe, and the unregister function (phy_led_triggers_unregister)\nis called from phy_detach, not phy_remove. This means the register and\nunregister functions can be called multiple times for the same PHY\ndevice, but devm-allocated memory is not freed until the driver is\nunbound.\n\nThis also prevents kmemleak from detecting the leak, as the devm API\ninternally stores the allocated pointer.\n\nFix this by replacing devm_kzalloc/devm_kcalloc with standard\nkzalloc/kcalloc, and add the corresponding kfree calls in the unregister\npath.",
