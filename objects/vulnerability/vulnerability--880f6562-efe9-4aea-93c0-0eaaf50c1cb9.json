            "description": "The NiceJob plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several of the plugin's shortcodes (nicejob-lead, nicejob-review, nicejob-engage, nicejob-badge, nicejob-stories) in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
