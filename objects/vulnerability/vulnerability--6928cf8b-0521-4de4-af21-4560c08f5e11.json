            "description": "The Nested Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'settingsPage' function and missing santization of the 'tab' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call local php files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
