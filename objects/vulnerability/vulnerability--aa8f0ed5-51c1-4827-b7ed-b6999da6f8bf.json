            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntick/nohz: unexport __init-annotated tick_nohz_full_setup()\n\nEXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text\nsection is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot\nuse symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up\nwith kernel panic.\n\nmodpost used to detect it, but it had been broken for a decade.\n\nCommit 28438794aba4 (\"modpost: fix section mismatch check for exported\ninit/exit sections\") fixed it so modpost started to warn it again, then\nthis showed up:\n\n    MODPOST vmlinux.symvers\n  WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(___ksymtab_gpl+tick_nohz_full_setup+0x0): Section mismatch in reference from the variable __ksymtab_tick_nohz_full_setup to the function .init.text:tick_nohz_full_setup()\n  The symbol tick_nohz_full_setup is exported and annotated __init\n  Fix this by removing the __init annotation of tick_nohz_full_setup or drop the export.\n\nDrop the export because tick_nohz_full_setup() is only called from the\nbuilt-in code in kernel/sched/isolation.c.",
