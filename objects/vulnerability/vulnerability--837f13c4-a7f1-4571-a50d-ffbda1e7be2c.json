            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nusb: dwc3: host: Stop setting the ACPI companion\n\nIt is no longer needed. The sysdev pointer is now used when\nassigning the ACPI companions to the xHCI ports and USB\ndevices.\n\nAssigning the ACPI companion here resulted in the\nfwnode->secondary pointer to be replaced also for the parent\ndwc3 device since the primary fwnode (the ACPI companion)\nwas shared. That was unintentional and it created potential\nside effects like resource leaks.",
