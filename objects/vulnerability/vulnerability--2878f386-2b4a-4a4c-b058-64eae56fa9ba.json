            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning\n\nIt turns out that SLUB redzoning (\"slub_debug=Z\") checks from\ns->object_size rather than from s->inuse (which is normally bumped to\nmake room for the freelist pointer), so a cache created with an object\nsize less than 24 would have the freelist pointer written beyond\ns->object_size, causing the redzone to be corrupted by the freelist\npointer.  This was very visible with \"slub_debug=ZF\":\n\n  BUG test (Tainted: G    B            ): Right Redzone overwritten\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  INFO: 0xffff957ead1c05de-0xffff957ead1c05df @offset=1502.
