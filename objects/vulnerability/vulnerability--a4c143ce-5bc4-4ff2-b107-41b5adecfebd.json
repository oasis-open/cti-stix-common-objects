            "description": "Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.2.0, when sharing an item, a typical user can specify an arbitrary role. It allows the user to use a higher-privileged role to see fields that otherwise the user should not be able to see. Instances that are impacted are those that use the share feature and have specific roles hierarchy and fields that are not visible for certain roles. Version 11.2.0 contains a patch the issue.",
