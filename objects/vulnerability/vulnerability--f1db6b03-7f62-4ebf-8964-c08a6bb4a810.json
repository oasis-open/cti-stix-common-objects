            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole\n\nThe syzbot constructs a directory that has no dirblock but is non-inline,\ni.e. the first directory block is a hole. And no errors are reported when\ncreating files in this directory in the following flow.\n\n    ext4_mknod\n     ...\n      ext4_add_entry\n        // Read block 0\n        ext4_read_dirblock(dir, block, DIRENT)\n          bh = ext4_bread(NULL, inode, block, 0)\n          if (!bh && (type == INDEX || type == DIRENT_HTREE))\n          // The first directory block is a hole\n          // But type == DIRENT, so no error is reported.\n\nAfter that, we get a directory block without '.' and '..' but with a valid\ndentry. This may cause some code that relies on dot or dotdot (such as\nmake_indexed_dir()) to crash.\n\nTherefore when ext4_read_dirblock() finds that the first directory block\nis a hole report that the filesystem is corrupted and return an error to\navoid loading corrupted data from disk causing something bad.",
