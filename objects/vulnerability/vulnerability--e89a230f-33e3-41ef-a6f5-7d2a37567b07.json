            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/vmwgfx: Fix prime with external buffers\n\nMake sure that for external buffers mapping goes through the dma_buf\ninterface instead of trying to access pages directly.\n\nExternal buffers might not provide direct access to readable/writable\npages so to make sure the bo's created from external dma_bufs can be\nread dma_buf interface has to be used.\n\nFixes crashes in IGT's kms_prime with vgem. Regular desktop usage won't\ntrigger this due to the fact that virtual machines will not have\nmultiple GPUs but it enables better test coverage in IGT.",
