            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops\n\nCommit 66600fac7a98 (\"net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap\nfor non-paged SKB data\") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s\nmembers to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().\n\nThe buf (dma cookie) and len stored in this structure are passed to\ndma_unmap_single() by stmmac_tx_clean(). The DMA API requires that\nthe dma cookie passed to dma_unmap_single() is the same as the value\nreturned from dma_map_single(). However, by moving the assignment\nlater, this is not the case when priv->dma_cap.addr64 > 32 as \"des\"\nis offset by proto_hdr_len.\n\nThis causes problems such as:\n\n  dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet eth0: Tx DMA map failed\n\nand with DMA_API_DEBUG enabled:\n\n  DMA-API: dwc-eth-dwmac 2490000.ethernet: device driver tries to +free DMA memory it has not allocated [device address=0x000000ffffcf65c0] [size=66 bytes]\n\nFix this by maintaining \"des\" as the original DMA cookie, and use\ntso_des to pass the offset DMA cookie to stmmac_tso_allocator().\n\nFull details of the crashes can be found at:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/d8112193-0386-4e14-b516-37c2d838171a@nvidia.com/\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/klkzp5yn5kq5efgtrow6wbvnc46bcqfxs65nz3qy77ujr5turc@bwwhelz2l4dw/",
