            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsoc: qcom: pdr: Fix the potential deadlock\n\nWhen some client process A call pdr_add_lookup() to add the look up for\nthe service and does schedule locator work, later a process B got a new\nserver packet indicating locator is up and call pdr_locator_new_server()\nwhich eventually sets pdr->locator_init_complete to true which process A\nsees and takes list lock and queries domain list but it will timeout due\nto deadlock as the response will queued to the same qmi->wq and it is\nordered workqueue and process B is not able to complete new server\nrequest work due to deadlock on list lock.\n\nFix it by removing the unnecessary list iteration as the list iteration\nis already being done inside locator work, so avoid it here and just\ncall schedule_work() here.\n\n       Process A                        Process B\n\n                                     process_scheduled_works()\npdr_add_lookup()                      qmi_data_ready_work()\n process_scheduled_works()             pdr_locator_new_server()\n                                         pdr->locator_init_complete=true;\n   pdr_locator_work()\n    mutex_lock(&pdr->list_lock);\n\n     pdr_locate_service()                  mutex_lock(&pdr->list_lock);\n\n      pdr_get_domain_list()\n       pr_err(\"PDR: %s get domain list\n               txn wait failed: %d\\n\",\n               req->service_name,\n               ret);\n\nTimeout error log due to deadlock:\n\n\"\n PDR: tms/servreg get domain list txn wait failed: -110\n PDR: service lookup for msm/adsp/sensor_pd:tms/servreg failed: -110\n\"\n\nThanks to Bjorn and Johan for letting me know that this commit also fixes\nan audio regression when using the in-kernel pd-mapper as that makes it\neasier to hit this race.
