            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails\n\nCommit b7c0ccdfbafd (\"mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()\")\nskips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.\n\nHowever, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the\nentire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap\nentries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries\nthat were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become\ninconsistent.\n\nThis inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:\n  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap\n  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng\n  $ sudo reboot\n\n  The two warnings are:\n    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():\n      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));\n\n    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():\n      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, \"page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\\n\",\n\t  new, nr_pages))\n\nzswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.\n\nAs suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap\nentries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,\nzswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries\nwhen it failed to zswap the entire folio.\n\nWhile this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and\nincrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and\nleave the optimization for later after some evaluation.\n\nAfter resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.\n\n[42.hyeyoo@gmail.com: refactor zswap_store_page()]\n  Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20250131082037.2426-1-42.hyeyoo@gmail.com",
