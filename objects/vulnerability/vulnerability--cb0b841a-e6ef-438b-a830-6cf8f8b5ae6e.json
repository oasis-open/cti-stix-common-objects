            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix race in read_extent_buffer_pages()\n\nThere are reports from tree-checker that detects corrupted nodes,\nwithout any obvious pattern so possibly an overwrite in memory.\nAfter some debugging it turns out there's a race when reading an extent\nbuffer the uptodate status can be missed.\n\nTo prevent concurrent reads for the same extent buffer,\nread_extent_buffer_pages() performs these checks:\n\n    /* (1) */\n    if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags))\n        return 0;\n\n    /* (2) */\n    if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags))\n        goto done;\n\nAt this point, it seems safe to start the actual read operation. Once\nthat completes, end_bbio_meta_read() does\n\n    /* (3) */\n    set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb);\n\n    /* (4) */\n    clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags);\n\nNormally, this is enough to ensure only one read happens, and all other\ncallers wait for it to finish before returning.  Unfortunately, there is\na racey interleaving:\n\n    Thread A | Thread B | Thread C\n    ---------+----------+---------\n       (1)   |          |\n             |    (1)   |\n       (2)   |          |\n       (3)   |          |\n       (4)   |          |\n             |    (2)   |\n             |          |    (1)\n\nWhen this happens, thread B kicks of an unnecessary read. Worse, thread\nC will see UPTODATE set and return immediately, while the read from\nthread B is still in progress.  This race could result in tree-checker\nerrors like this as the extent buffer is concurrently modified:\n\n    BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=256\n    block=8550954455682405139 owner mismatch, have 11858205567642294356\n    expect [256, 18446744073709551360]\n\nFix it by testing UPTODATE again after setting the READING bit, and if\nit's been set, skip the unnecessary read.\n\n[ minor update of changelog ]",
