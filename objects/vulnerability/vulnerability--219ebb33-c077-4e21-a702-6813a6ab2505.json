Attempting to access this non-functional\nsensor via iio_info causes system hangs as runtime PM tries to wake up\nan unresponsive sensor.\n\n  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: Report latency attributes: ffffffff:ffffffff\n  [453] hid-sensor-hub 0003:0408:5473.0003: common attributes: 5:1, 2:1, 3:1 ffffffff:ffffffff\n\nAdd this device to the HID ignore list since the sensor interface is\nnon-functional by design and should not be exposed to userspace.",
