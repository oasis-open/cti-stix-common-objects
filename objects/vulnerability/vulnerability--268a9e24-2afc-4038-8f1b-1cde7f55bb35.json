            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbinder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()\n\nTask A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on\na remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm\nvia mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the\nfinal mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.\n\n  Task A            | Task B\n  ------------------+------------------\n  mmget_not_zero()  |\n                    |  do_exit()\n                    |    exit_mm()\n                    |      mmput()\n  mmput()           |\n    exit_mmap()     |\n      remove_vma()  |\n        fput()      |\n\nIn this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A\nas TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup\nwork gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply\nfrom Task B that never comes (it's dead).\n\nThis means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated\nbinder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated\ndeath notifications will also be delayed until then.\n\nIn order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in\nthe corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.",
