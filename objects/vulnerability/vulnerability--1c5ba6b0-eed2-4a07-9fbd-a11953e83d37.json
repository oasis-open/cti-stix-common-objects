            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\n\nThis commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in\ndcn20_program_pipe(). Previously, commit 8e4ed3cf1642 (\"drm/amd/display:\nAdd null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in dcn20_program_pipe\")\npartially fixed the null pointer dereference issue. However, in\ndcn20_update_dchubp_dpp(), the variable pipe_ctx is passed in, and\nplane_state is accessed again through pipe_ctx. Multiple if statements\ndirectly call attributes of plane_state, leading to potential null\npointer dereference issues. This patch adds necessary null checks to\nensure stability.",
