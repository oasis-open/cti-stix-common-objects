            "description": "Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) is an interactive video and image annotation tool for computer vision. If an attacker can trick a logged-in CVAT user into visiting a maliciously-constructed URL, they can initiate any API calls on that user's behalf. This gives the attacker temporary access to all data that the victim user has access to. Upgrade to CVAT 2.19.0 or a later version to fix this issue.",
