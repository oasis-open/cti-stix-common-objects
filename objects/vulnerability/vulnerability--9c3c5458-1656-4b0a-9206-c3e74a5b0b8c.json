            "description": "Applio is a voice conversion tool. Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to unsafe deserialization in inference.py. `model_file` in inference.py as well as `model_file` in tts.py take user-supplied input (e.g. a path to a model) and pass that value to the `change_choices` and later to `get_speakers_id` function, which loads that model with `torch.load` in inference.py (line 326 in 3.2.8-bugfix), which is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization. The issue can lead to remote code execution. A patch is available on the `main` branch of the repository.",
