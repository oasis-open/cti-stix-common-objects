            "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfilter: nf_tables: adapt set backend to use GC transaction API\n\nUse the GC transaction API to replace the old and buggy gc API and the\nbusy mark approach.\n\nNo set elements are removed from async garbage collection anymore,\ninstead the _DEAD bit is set on so the set element is not visible from\nlookup path anymore. Async GC enqueues transaction work that might be\naborted and retried later.\n\nrbtree and pipapo set backends does not set on the _DEAD bit from the\nsync GC path since this runs in control plane path where mutex is held.\nIn this case, set elements are deactivated, removed and then released\nvia RCU callback, sync GC never fails.",
