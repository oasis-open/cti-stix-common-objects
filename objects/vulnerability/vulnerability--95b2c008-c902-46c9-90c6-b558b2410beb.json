In case of failure,\nchan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is nullified.\nWhen dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API or\nintentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionally\nunregistered, leading to this NULL pointer:\n[    1.318693] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0\n[...]\n[    1.484499] Call trace:\n[    1.486930]  device_del+0x40/0x394\n[    1.490314]  device_unregister+0x20/0x7c\n[    1.494220]  __dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0\n\nLook at dma_async_device_register() function error path, channel device\nunregistration is done only if chan->local is not NULL.\n\nThen add the same condition at the beginning of\n__dma_async_device_channel_unregister() function, to avoid NULL pointer\nissue whatever the API used to reach this function.",
