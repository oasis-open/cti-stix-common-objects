toc::[]

[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

The current STIX 2.1 Incident object exists as a stub in the hopes that future work would allow STIX Incidents to be more fully fleshed out using extensions, and that in time a set of core features could be defined to be migrated into a future version of the Incident object or the community could arrive at the consensus to continue to use these extensions.

In the 1.0 version of the core incident extension information on impact, events, and tasks were embedded within the Incident itself, however this was found to have limitations.
As such a 2.0 version of this extension has been created in order to separate these components into independent SDOs to allow for expression using both external and embedded relationships.

These extensions are allow tracking incidents across their life cycle where Events are first flagged for investigation resulting in [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# with [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># being worked to resolve these.
Incidents have impacts that change over time as these [stixtype]#<<event,events>># are determined to have [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>># which are in turn mitigated and potentially resolved by [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># performed as part of the incident response process.
Both [stixtype]#<<event,events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># can exist independently of [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# and in most workflows will occur prior to an incident being declared.


== 1. Incidents in STIX

Incident objects represent cases composed of events and tasks which can have impacts.
An Incident SDO can be created prior to a formal determination that the incident has an impact as a way to logically track case work in an attempt to investigate events or lower level alerts.
The Incident object should have sufficient properties to represent the current state of the incident or investigation while serving as an anchor point to record both activities related to the and the impact to the enterprise.

== 2. Extensions

=== 2.1. Incident Core

The properties and additional types within the Incident Core Extension are defined below. As this is not a top-level object, fields such as identifier are not present.

|*incident_types* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{list_url}[list]# of type [stixtype]#{open_vocab_url}[open-vocab]#
|This property uses an Open Vocabulary that specifies the type of incident that occurred, if applicable.

|*recoverability* (optional)
|[stixtype]#<<recoverability-enum,recoverability-enum>>#
|The recoverability of this particular Incident with respect to feasibility and required time and resources.

==== 2.3.2. Extensions

The Impact SDO is currently an extension, but as there are many specific types of impacts with their own unique properties it emulates the File SCO through the use of STIX Extensions to provide the granular details of specific categories of impacts.
As such every Impact *MUST* have an extension that has the same value of the *impact_category*.
This allows consumers to quickly validate their ability to process this category of impact and then load all of its specific details.

Producers *SHOULD* use one of the extensions  not be used by different impact detail objects.
