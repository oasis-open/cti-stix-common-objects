toc::[]

[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

The current STIX 2.1 Incident object was defined as a stub with the expectation that it would be fleshed out using extensions, and that in time either a set of core features would be integrated into a future version of the STIX or that the community would arrive at the consensus to continue to use these extensions.

In the 1.0 version of the core incident extension, information on impact, events, and tasks were embedded within the Incident object itself, however this was found to have limitations.
Therefore, the 2.0 version of this extension has been created in which these components have been separated into independent SDOs for more complex incidents to be accurately modeled.

These extensions allow incidents to be tracked across their life cycle where [stixtype]#<<event,events>># are first flagged for investigation resulting in [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# with [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># being worked to resolve them.
Incidents have [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>># that change over time.
[stixtype]#<<event,events>># can cause or influence these [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>># which are in turn mitigated and potentially resolved by [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># performed as part of the incident response process.
Both [stixtype]#<<event,events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># can exist independently of [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# and in most workflows will occur prior to an incident being declared.

[[incident]]
== 1. Incidents in STIX

Incident objects represent cases composed of [stixtype]#<<event,events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># as well as actual or potential [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>>#.
An Incident SDO can be created prior to a formal determination that the incident has an impact as a way to logically track case work in an attempt to investigate events or lower level alerts.

The Incident object should have sufficient properties to represent the current state of the incident or investigation while serving as an anchor point to record both related activities and the impact to an organization.

== 2. Extensions

=== 2.1. Incident Core

The properties and additional types within the Incident Core Extension are defined below. As this is an extension of a top-level object, common properties such as *id* are not present, but are present in the [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incident]# object stub .  This extension *MUST* use [stixliteral]#extension-definition--ef765651-680c-498d-9894-99799f2fa126# as its extension ID.

|A high-level determination on the status of this incident.
The value of this property *SHOULD* be [stixliteral]#suspected# until enough information is available to provide a well researched result.

Some automated tools may flag results as [stixliteral]#blocked# or [stixliteral]#low-value# automatically depending on the tool type or activity.
For example, a tool that blocks a series of phishing emails may create an incident with a [stixliteral]#blocked# determination automatically.

The values of this property *MUST* come from the [stixtype]#<<incident-determination-enum,incident-determination-enum>># enumeration.

|*extension_type* (required)
|[stixtype]#{string_url}[string]# 
|The value of this property *MUST* be [stixliteral]#property-extension#

|*criticality* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{int_url}[integer]#
 
|The criticality of the incident.
If present, this value *MUST* be an integer between 0 and 100. This can be translated into qualitative values as described in <<appendix-b,Appendix B>>.

|*detection_methods* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{list_url}[list]# of type [stixtype]#{open_vocab_url}[open-vocab]#
|A list of strings corresponding to the methods used to detect the activity, e.g., commercial tool names, techniques associated with proprietary solutions, human review, external sources, or other methods.

These values *SHOULD* be selected from the [stixtype]#<<detection-methods-ov,detection-methods-ov>># open vocabulary.

|*event_refs* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{list_url}[list]# of type [stixtype]#{identifier_url}[identifier]#
|A list of events tied to this incident.
It *MUST* contain references to one or more [stixtype]#<<event, event>># objects.

Events can be grouped into sequences based on the *next_events_refs* property of the relevant [stixtype]#<<event, event>># objects. Events that are the first in a sequence are not referenced by the *next_event_refs* property of any other [stixtype]#<<event, event>># object.

|*impact_refs* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{list_url}[list]# of type [stixtype]#{identifier_url}[identifier]#
|A list of the impacts of this incident.
All objects referenced in this list *MUST* be an [stixtype]#<<impact,impact>># object.

The value of this property *MUST* come from the [stixtype]#<<recoverability-enum,recoverability-enum>>#
enumeration.

|*scores* (optional)
|[stixtype]#{list_url}[list]# of type [stixtype]#<<incident-score,incident-score>>#
|A list of scores from various automated or manual mechanisms along with optional descriptions.

==== 2.1.1. Relationships
// tag::incident-relationships[]

These are the relationships explicitly defined between the Incident object and other STIX Objects.
The table identifies the relationships that can be made from this object type to another object
type by way of the Relationship object.

The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships
targeting this object type from another object type. 

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects
using the [stixrelationship]#related-to# relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.

Because of this,
these relationships can be used with the Incident object as defined in the STIX 2.1 specification.

[[event]]
=== 2.2. Event

An Event is an activity that has a harmful effect or which will be investigated or already has been investigated as potentially having a harmful effect. The activity is not necessarily performed by an attacker. For example, an event could result from a user or system administrator's mistake. Events can be used to further enrich and explain Sightings by allowing analysts to indicate if these sightings are part of a potential threat, and if so how they connects to a larger incident. Some activity, described in an Event, will be found to be not harmful when investigated.

This new SDO extension *MUST* use [stixliteral]#extension-definition--4ca6de00-5b0d-45ef-a1dc-ea7279ea910e# as its extension ID.

As a new SDO extension it must follow the requirements as described in section 7.3.2.2 of the STIX 2.1 specification.

An Impact is the result of the Incident on the victim, captured in the *impact_ref* property of the Incident object. Impacts can have many categories: availability of resources, confidentiality of data, integrity of data or resources, monetary, physical damage, damage to others and traceability (auditing). 

This new SDO extension *MUST* use [stixliteral]#extension-definition--7cc33dd6-f6a1-489b-98ea-522d351d71b9# as its extension ID.

==== 2.3.1. Relationships

// tag::impact-relationships[]
There are no relationships explicitly defined between the Impact object and other STIX
Objects, other than those defined as common relationships ([stixrelationship]#duplicate-of#, [stixrelationship]#derived-from#, [stixrelationship]#related-to#, and the embedded relationships defined by the common SDO properties.)

The reverse relationships section illustrates the relationships
targeting this object type from another object type. 

Relationships are not restricted to those listed below. Relationships can be created between any objects
using the [stixrelationship]#related-to# relationship type or, as with open vocabularies, user-defined names.

==== 2.3.2. Extensions

There are many types of impacts, each with its own unique properties, therefore the Impact SDO emulates the File SCO through the use of STIX (sub-type) Extensions to provide the granular details of specific categories of impacts. Seven extensions to [stixtype]#<<impact,impact>>#, which further define the impact on a related Incident, are given below.
As such, every Impact *MUST* have the one extension which matches the value of the *impact_category* property (see this property description above).  
This allows consumers to quickly validate their ability to process this category of impact and then load all of its specific details.

Because these extensions are used to specify very different types of impacts, producers *SHOULD* use one and only one of these extensions per Impact object. However, additional extensions might be proposed in the future and might be used in conjunction with one of these.
